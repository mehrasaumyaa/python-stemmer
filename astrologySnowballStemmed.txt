her mother love told by the physician by general although unspoken assent the eye of all the compani were now direct to the vener hakeem as if to invit from him the next contribut to the night entertain 
medit for a moment the man of medicin stroke the broad white beard that descend almost to his girdl and then began familiar to us all is the thought that death is but a birth into anoth state of exist whether that state be the etern paradis which is the final goal of everi man hope or mere anoth stage thitherward 
death is a birth the truth of which will more forcibl appeal to our mind when we reflect also that birth is a death 
how can that be except for the stillborn 
queri the astrolog 
the hakeem rais a hand deprec the interrupt 
nay follow me in my argument he continu quiet 
if death is a birth then is a birth truli death 
for the babe has been live through a prior stage of exist 
to it the nine month pass in it mother womb may have meant a long span of life 
for time is but a relat term and measur against etern the whole period of man sojourn onpg 147 earth be it three score or four score year is but as the puff of a singl breath 
so the child in the womb live there a full span of exist it is nurtur and it grow it sleep and it wake it lie passiv and it disport itself it is sensit to cold and to heat to thirst and to hunger and god alon know what it think and what mental impress it form of the exist through which it is pass 
and the hour of it birth is truli the hour of it death for in pain and travail it is pluck from it warm and comfort surround and with the shock of physic chang and unse dread it cri aloud in sharp anguish 
thus precis do we ourselv die when we pass from this world to anoth exist physic and mental resent the harsh chang terrifi becaus of our veri ignor of what is realli happen 
the physician paus amid a deep hush that bore eloqu testimoni to the impress of the thought to which he had given utter 
but the parallel doe not end here he resum 
when the infant is born then for the first time doe it see face to face the divin who through all the preced stage of it exist has protect it warm it and nourish it 
in the presenc of it mother it is in the presenc of the god who has hitherto envelop it wholli and complet in his own divin be 
so when we die will we be face to face with the now unseen god who everywher encompass us behold him at first onli with the dazzl vision and dim halfconsci of the newpg 148born babe but grow to know him and to love him as we have all known and love the devot mother who bore us 
for mother love is man first foretast of god love the full glori of which we shall comprehend onli when by death we are born into a higher and more spacious sphere of exist 
there was anoth brief interv of silenc again unbroken by ani comment from the auditor 
then the hakeem continu in lighter tone now let me point my moral by tell you a stori of a mother suprem devot for her son 
at one time i practis my profess in the capit citi of a state rule over by a maharajah who although he had been a brave and honour man in his prime had degener into a mere voluptuari spend his day in the companionship of nautch girl and disreput men indulg constant in immoder potat of strong wine and given at time to the use of bhang which doe more than anyth els to dull the faculti and deaden the conscienc of the unfortun who surrend himself to it seduct spell 
the inevit result were for him the prematur loss of health and strength and for his peopl misrul extort and widespread unhappi 
it happen that after sever hindu physician had fail to restor their royal master from a faint spell i a moslem was summon in hast to the palac 
i carri with me a small jar contain a certain pungent liquid which i appli to the nospg 149tril of my patient with the result that he was straightway brought back from seem death to conscious of his surround 
i take no special credit for effect this recoveri but the maharajah himself deem me to be a verit worker of miracl and dismiss all his other doctor kept me thenceforth constant by his side 
from the first i knew by his trembl limb and enfeebl condit that death had mark him for it own but i could at least prepar aromat drink to mitig his pain and saffron meat to drive out the evil spirit that possess him 
thus did it come about that i gain the confid of the maharajah and when it happen that one of his favourit wive had fallen into a declin and had beg for the servic of a physician the honour trust of minist to her need was confid to me 
my examin of the invalid was in accord with the usual restrict 
accompani by the feebl old maharajah himself i was conduct to an apart across which a heavi curtain was suspend 
after an interv of wait the rustl of silken garment behind the purdah follow by the gentl sigh of a woman told me that my patient had arriv 
it was the husband himself who bade her thrust her tongu through an orific in the curtain 
my inspect of this member reveal no intern disord and i request from my master permiss to touch the ladi hand so that i might feel the puls of the blood in her vein 
not too will he order her to push her arm through the open 
pg 150 it was a dainti white hand with mani jewel ring upon the taper finger and the nail as with all ladi of qualiti dy the deep orang red of henna 
although i knew well that the jealous watch eye of her lord were upon me i made no hesit in encompass the wrist with my own finger 
but the littl hand within mine was clench tight and the better to conduct my examin i freed my finger from her wrist so as to straighten out her as i requir them 
when i attempt to do this howev i was conscious of some resist and then of the presenc of a small packet conceal in the palm of her hand 
with a flash of comprehens i knew that the packag must be intend to be convey to me surreptiti and with no thought at that critic moment of what the ulterior object might be i aid the act by a deft movement of my shoulder which for a moment intercept the maharajah gaze 
in anoth second he could see my fingertip light press on her wrist and her empti hand extend but the packag was safe in my other hand and not the quiver of a muscl on my face betray that anyth unusu had happen 
both to mask my feel and to give the ladi behind the curtain confid that she could repos trust in my discret i count the puls beat aloud 
these inde told me that the heart of my patient was beat at a mad gallop but this i divin was simpli caus by the dare deed she had essay and success accomplish 
i deem it wise andpg 151 prudent howev to announc that the ladi was suffer from a fever and that i would send her a powder that would speedili restor her to good health 
at this the maharajah was suffici overjoy to permit of my withdraw without obvious embarrass 
i had a smile upon my lip and the secret packag secur in the fold of my girdl 
a chuprassi accompani me to my home to bring back the medicin 
i knew of cours that it was onli a dri powder that this highborn hindu ladi could take from my dispensari for to have swallow a liquid drug would have been a violat of her cast 
i took pain to let the chuprassi see that my hand did not touch the powder which after due weigh i bestow in a paper care seal instruct him to deliv it to no one but his high the maharajah 
it was onli fine ground sugar that the man carri away 
but perhap this is a harmless littl trick of my profess which even now i should not disclos 
but a general smile among the compani show the hakeem that his call was held in no undu rever at least by those without present need of his ministr 
when i was alon with my mortar and my drug resum the narrat i lost no time in examin the mysteri packet 
i unwound the silk thread that tight tie it both to restrict it bulk and to render it secur 
soon to my amaz i uncov a string of ten pearl of a size and lustrouspg 152 puriti that bespok a high valu even to my untutor eye 
also there was a littl seal of red chalcedoni with the antler head of a deer and some scroll of letter engrav upon it but there was not one scrap of write to explain to me the reason of these gift 
had the ladi as often happen imagin herself to be serious sick and devis this plan of invok my interest and most skil servic on her behalf 
but whi then the seal the valu of which was quit insignific 
even as i was ponder these question there came a clap of hand at the gateway of my home that announc the arriv of a visitor 
hastili conceal the pearl and the seal in my girdl i step forth into the outer court and took my seat upon the divan 
straightway there was usher into my presenc a big man cloth in rich garment 
his sabl complexion and thick lip declar him to be a moorman from across the sea and his beardless chin further told at a glanc that he was an attend at the seraglio of some rich nobl 
he salaam me with the cool confid of his kind and without wait for an invit seat himself on the carpet at my feet 
my name o learn hakeem is malik kafur he began in the shrill trebl voic i had anticip and you know whi i come here 
as my knowledg had been taken for grant i bow in acquiesc 
but her high said that you would first of all show me her signetpg 153 so as to prove that you are act with her author 
with all due graviti i produc the chalcedoni seal from my belt and without quit hold extend it for my visitor inspect 
there was a swift gleam of recognit in his eye 
that is right he murmur 
then proceed i said quiet 
you can speak in the fullest confid 
i have promis the maharane that tomorrow when the fourth of the day is over i shall conduct her into the bazaar 
she bade me explain her plan precis so that you in turn should know how to act 
well her high will be as usual in her palankeen slung between two mule 
when we turn from the coppersmith bazaar into the seclud bazaar where the money changer dwell the two groom in charg of the mule will be assail by budmash and beaten with stick 
i too will be knock down and my cloth torn but do not worri on my account 
i gave a cheer nod to signifi that his anxieti on this score might be set at rest 
it will devolv on you to have two men readi to take advantag of the confus of the scuffl and lead away the mule with the palankeen conduct the maharane to a place which she herself will indic 
this you understand 
i understand 
at night when i shall come to you again underpg 154 cover of the dark you will pay over to me the agreedupon price—th ten pearl which her high has place in your custodi 
they are here i assent hold aloft the littl string of pearl the purpos they were intend to serv at last made clear to my understand 
the eye of the negro flash with cupid and he reach forth a big fat black hand 
i can be trust to do my share of the task he said eager 
to save troubl let me be paid now 
not so thou slave i repli curt and with author as i return the pearl to their place of safekeep 
the price will be paid when the servic is perform 
tomorrow night you will be admit malik kafur if you knock three time at my gate 
the fellow rose to his feet with a servil and submiss smile and by a wave of my hand i dismiss him from my presenc 
here inde was an adventur thrust upon me a man of peac and of studious habit who had ever shrunk from deed of violenc but the hand of fate was clear beckon me along the path of duti and not for a moment did i shrink from the danger into which perchanc i was be hurri 
for the maharajah worthless besot and on the verg of dishonour death i could have no respect 
for the ladi of his household who was confid to me her veri life whose soft hand i had touch with due rever there was an instinct feel of sympathi 
in her hour of dire needpg 155 most like of extrem danger she had turn to me a man of staid reput and old enough no doubt to be her father 
so this was no affair of conjug wrong from which my religi scrupl and my abid principl alik would have repel me 
clear was i the instrument in god direct hand for some great happen and it was not for me through thought of self or cowardic to interpos obstacl to the carri out of the divin will 
and as i thus rumin there came from a minaret close by the call to even prayer 
the world is but an hour i murmur to myself as i spread my carpet spend it in devot the rest is unseen 
on the morrow i was astir even befor the morn call to prayer 
prayer is better than sleep—i listen to the familiar cri of the muezzin 
but while again i pray i felt that a good deed done may count more for a man at the gate of paradis than the record of mani prayer 
full an hour befor the appoint time i was at the corner of the coppersmith and the moneychang bazaar 
here i post two of my retain in whom i could place complet confid 
they had alreadi been instruct how to act when the proper moment arriv 
for myself i saunter through the crowd and noisi bazaar of the maker and mender of copper vessel so as not to attract undu attent 
in my heart was not one flutter of excit or of uncertainti i felt the quiet confid which in the crisespg 156 of life come to a man whose trust in god the most high is implicit 
after a period of wait there came into sight the huge black moorman in his hand a white wand of offic and follow close behind him a brilliant decor palankeen suspend between a pair of mule and attend by two groom lead the anim 
the throng had part befor this littl process avert their eye from the cover palankeen as was beseem 
but sudden at the intersect of the two bazaar a group of loiter sprang forward and with cri assail the moorman and the groom turn the mule into the quieter thoroughfar 
there i had now post myself and while the shopkeep ran up the street to see what had befallen the cavalcad under my direct and with my attend at the anim head hurri along and as we thread our way through the maze of street the tumult of voic soon die away behind us 
after a littl time i ventur to approach the curtain palankin 
i spoke just loud enough to be heard by it occup may your day o queen be peac 
your servant most humbl and devot await your order 
peac be to thee o thou trust and brave hakeem 
take me to the protect of thi wife and home 
it was a soft melodi woman voic that hadpg 157 spoken trembl implor and yet withal in a tone of author 
as thou hast command so shall it be done was my brief repli 
after a littl time the cavalcad without ani undu attent be attract had pass through the gateway of my home and the door had been bar behind us 
to my surpris a gallant youth some twelv year of age sprang through the momentarili part curtain of the palankeen 
i salut thee o hakeem our deliver he exclaim kiss the hem of my robe 
my royal mother is in the palankeen and crave for sanctuari in your zenana 
let her pass i repli and i urg the docil mule toward the second archway that led to the women courtyard 
at my bid the inner gate open and they close again when the palankeen had enter 
within is sanctuari for your royal mother and here is sanctuari for yourself o princ i continu with a profound obeis for despit the modest garment he wore i had recogn the eldest royal son of the maharajah whom i had seen sever time in his father presenc and on one occas at an affair of state clad in a robe of honour of silk and gold brocad festoon of jewel around his neck and a tini sword with scabbard of gold girt at his side 
have onc more impress secreci on my attend and bid them give admiss to no onepg 158 i led my young guest into an inner recept room 
there in a few concis sentenc he told me his stori 
a plot had been hatch in the royal zenana that just so soon as the maharajah die this youth and seven or eight younger brother son of other wive should be slain so that the undisput success might descend on one particular son elder by sever year but not in the regular line of success becaus born of a slave mother 
it was this slave woman brother who command the maharajah bodyguard and in collus with his sister had conceiv the damnabl conspiraci 
onli by the whisper of a woman who was close to the offic but whose heart was tender had the mother of the young heir to the throne been warn 
with my aid and that of the eunuch who had visit me the day befor they had made their escap the youth have been hidden in the palankeen of his mother befor the latter left the seraglio on one of her occasion visit to the bazaar 
such was the stori 
now the futur had to be plan for up to this point the maharane had act blind and impulsively—just swiftly—th moment she had realiz the suprem danger for her son 
in the boy i found high courag and a clear brain and togeth we devis the measur to be follow that would best allay suspicion as to the whereabout of the fugit 
as a first step i salli forth as usual to pay my profession visit on the maharajah a littl beforepg 159 the noontid hour 
perhap i felt that if by ani chanc suspicion had alreadi alight upon me i was take my life in my hand by enter the palac but trust to the protect of allah i gave no second thought to ani fear of this kind 
i had not yet reach the palac gate when i encount a messeng run in hot hast to summon me 
his high the maharajah had been seiz with a fit and the whole palac was in a turmoil 
when i gain the royal apart i saw at a glanc that the suffer was beyond human aid 
i could but watch the deep labour breath grow ever fainter and fainter until the deathrattl in the throat proclaim the end 
dure that hour of watch my soul had been grave perturb not becaus of the die debauche but in dread of sinist happen in the royal zenana when the news of the maharajah demis should come to be announc 
but how was i to give warn without betray to certain death the youth and his mother who had sought sanctuari in my defenceless home 
for there at the door of the sick room stood the captain of the king bodyguard todar rao the veri man who i knew held his corrupt soldieri in leash for ani villaini 
anoth high offic of the court the diwan had share my vigil in the death chamber and just befor the end came had inform me that it was news of an attack by budmash on one of the royal palankeen that morn in the bazaar that hadpg 160 inflict the fatal stroke upon his master 
but this treasur was an age man who would have quail under the eye of the stern and relentless soldier keep watch and ward at the doorway and for all i knew he too might be in the conspiracy—inde his furtiv glanc and the nervous twitch of his hand forewarn me of this danger 
surround by uncertainti and utter helpless in my isol i could but drift whither the stream of destini carri me 
the king is dead i announc when the last flutter of the heart had ceas 
may god in his compass give him peac 
the diwan summon the captain of the bodyguard and the latter to make certainti doubli sure brutal shook the dead man by the shoulder 
i could see the savag gleam of satisfact on his face when he threw from him the alreadi stiffen arm 
the two men in close conclav hasten from the chamber and when the attend set up the accustom cri of wail i profit by the clamour and confus to slip discreet from the palac and gain my own home 
the terribl event of the next few day were ala 
just the same as have befallen a hundr time on the pass of a king 
the outsid world knew few detail but the news from the palac current in the bazaar was that all the son of the late maharajah had perish except onli the eldest 
and this youth although the whisper pass freelypg 161 that he was mere the son of a slave woman duli ascend the throne 
revolt by some of the nobl over such an indign might come later on 
but meanwhil at all event the show of militari power quell all opposit while a judici remiss of tax pleas the general populac and inde caus them joy to acclaim the new maharajah as he made a triumphal process through the citi mount on an eleph caparison with cloth of gold and bedeck with silver chain and bell preced by priest and the danc girl of the templ and surround by troop both horsemen and foot soldier 
onli i and the member of my household knew that the right heir to the throne was aliv and in safe hide 
for the moorman had never come to claim his string of pearl and it was not until some day later that i had learn of his have been summarili dispatch by order of the dead maharajah in the latter first paroxysm of anger over the abduct of his favourit wife when visit the bazaar 
in this opportun remov of a greedi hirel and possibl traitor i onc more recogn the hand of provid work for the nobl woman whose quick wit had aid mother love to save her son 
a nobl woman i have call her and such inde she was 
for me the maharane had discard the purdah and in the sanctiti of my harem with my wife as her devot attend i was privileg to convers with her hour after hour gaze freelypg 162 upon the most beauti counten i had ever beheld—beauti not onli by reason of soft and round featur and the peach bloom of the skin but also becaus of the soullit eye that illumin it with joyous radianc 
for this queen live in her son forgot everi other sorrow in his safeti and now experienc all the glow pride of a leader on the field of battl in plan the campaign for the vindic of his right claim to the royal inherit 
her first step had been to send secret word to her father—sh was the daughter of a mountain chieftain—bid him to dispatch one of her brother to me as a trust messeng 
the distanc was far and three month elaps befor the hillman arriv a sturdi young fellow seren of eye slow of speech and muscl like a panther 
he depart back home again carri our tale by simpl word of mouth for greater secur and have conceal on his person some of the gem which the maharane had save and which would be readili convert into money 
then after a second interv of time other tribesmen came sift into the citi by twos and three until we had full fifti of the finest materi for a bodyguard a young princ could desir 
these men were quarter at differ place in the vicin of my home arm and readi for a general muster when the moment should be ripe for action 
meanwhil a widespread spirit of dissatisfact with the new raj was daili grow and on everi hand in the bazaar mutter of troubl began topg 163 be heard 
the young ruler had prove to be a mere puppet in the hand of his mother and uncl who had not hesit to advanc their baseborn relat and associ to place of highest honour and emolu therebi give grievous offenc among the famili of proud and ancient lineag both hindu and moslem which had hitherto suppli the princip offic of state and had been the real buttress of the throne 
then to fill full the measur of discont came omin rumour that the princ although still a mere youth had like his father becom addict to the use of bhang and strong wine and encourag by a worthless follow was abandon himself to all manner of expens debaucheri 
and when at last the screw of heavili increas taxat gave proof to these stori the first timid whisper of displeasur among the populac swell to sullen and continu murmur 
for the true queen mother and her son the hour of destini was approach 
but although the ember of revolt were readi to burst into flame at the first fan of a breez todar rao now sirdar in command of the whole armi still domin the situat 
at his slightest word the mercenari soldieri under his control would have rush into the bazaar with sword and torch like raven wolv among sheep helpless to defend themselv 
as for the nobl each surround by his own bodyguard they were torn into rival faction the one jealous watch the other lest open revolt should be made the excus forpg 164 usurp of the throne by the strongest and best prepar among them 
in these circumst it would have been fatal to let word go forth prematur that the right heir was aliv for disappoint ambit among the feudal lord might have becom an ad danger to the furi of the sirdar 
but ani prolong delay would also be disastr for it was onli now that the boy princ would be recogn and receiv as the undoubt heir to his father throne a few year later he would to a certainti be look at askanc as a mere pretender—a pawn in the game of some unscrupul kingmak play for his own aggrandiz 
it was the maharane who devis the bold stroke which involv undoubt danger yet promis the best chanc of success 
her idea was to take the whole court unawar at one and the same moment so that the nobl might have present to them not onli a common rallyingpoint for loyalti but the chanc by unit action to break for all time the hate militari power of the slaveborn sirdar 
it was the appoint day when the recent instal maharajah accord to custom immemori was to be public weigh and the gold he counterbalanc distribut in chariti 
in the great courtyard of the palac all the peopl were assembl nobl and offic of state soldier and trader rich and poor among the latter the halt the blind and the maim the deform and the leprous in piti evid as fit object for a share of the propg 165mise bounti 
on a rais dai seat upon a throne cover with cloth of gold and shelter by a canopi and awn of crimson brocad sat the reign maharajah a puni and sicklylook stripl 
befor the main ceremoni of the day herald had announc that the sovereign was prepar to listen to ani grievanc or complaint from his peopl 
for a few minut no one came forward but at last a pair of sleek mule handsom caparison with a rich adorn palankeen slung between them the ident equipag of the maharane which had been harbour in my home emerg from the crowd and advanc at a grave pace toward the royal dai 
that some highborn ladi was within the silken cover of the palankeen everi one surmis and at this extraordinari spectacl a hush of tens expect fell upon the assemblag 
but the silenc chang to murmur of amaz and admir when a queen woman step upon the edg of the dai and face not the maharajah on his throne but the nobl and courtier and offic cluster around 
with a proud gestur she flung even the sari from her face which the play of the sunbeam among the jewel in her hair and around her neck invest with a shimmer halo of radianc 
on such a woman face the multitud had never look befor 
but state and unabash seren in the puriti of her womanhood the digniti of her motherhood and the majesti of her rank she rais aloft a hand andpg 166 spake aloud in tone clear as the note of a silver trumpet 
o nobl and o peopl the royal son and heir of my husband the late maharajah is aliv spare by divin provid from the massacr of his brother and playmat in the seraglio of the palac 
mani of you know him well and behold now he come to claim his heritag 
as these word were spoken the crowd again part and there step forth the young princ my prot�g� 
at the edg of the throng he discard a loos mantl of cotton that had conceal the rich garment befit his rank 
then he advanc look proud and gaili about him while close behind and press eager around his person came full fifti stalwart tribesmen tread with the bold swing gait of the mountain their drawn tulwar flash in the sun their voic shout jai jai—hail hail 
in deafen chorus 
the effect was instantan and tremend and from all the assembl multitud went up the loud acclaim—jai jai jai 
there seem to be not a dissenti in the throng 
and a moment later the young princ was stand on the dai by his mother side one hand rest proud on her shoulder 
among the nobl there had hitherto been the silenc of stupefact 
but at last one of their number an elder man advanc and prostrat himself on the rich carpet spread in front of the dai thus render public homag to his right king 
jai jai jai 
shout the mob and soon apg 167 dozen other among the nobl had given the pledg of fealti 
meanwhil the kinglet on the throne of gold had been forgotten 
he had made no move but had content himself with stare around in confus and helpless surpris 
but now todar rao the sirdar had sprung to his side and drag the youth to his feet 
o princ and peopl this is your right king cri the soldier in stentorian tone crown and proclaim and accept by your pledg of loyalti 
my order to the troop are death to those who now betray him 
but the word had hard pass his lip when two score of the mountain shout deen deen—kil kill had swarm over the silver rail surround the throne 
there was the momentari clash of steel on steel the impot curs of an angri man a shrill piti cri of anguish from the youth who in his terror had crouch behind the awn descend from the canopi 
and when the tribesmen again face the multitud the soldier figur of todar rao had disappear and the throne was vacant for the recept of it right occup 
amidst a wild tumult of joy the young princ ascend from the dai and took the royal seat show in his everi movement the natur grace and digniti that might almost in themselv have prove his right of heritag and that certain won to his caus the last waver among the onlookingpg 168 multitud 
even the bodyguard of the slain sirdar were now join in the univers acclaim 
the first to bend a knee to the right king enthron was the royal queen his mother 
and then the ladi step back a littl to the rear and to the side of the throne draw her silken sari over the love counten that would never again be beholden by the peopl 
never again 
the thought had scarc pass through my mind as i watch the scene from the fring of the crowd when a more grim and terribl realiti was given to the unspoken word than i had ever intend 
close to the spot where the maharane had halt were some hang of brocad arrang as we understood later so that the seat and veil figur of a woman might observ the brilliant pageantri of the day from the privaci of this purdah 
and from out these hang there now stretch stealthili but swift a bejewel hand which plung a long dagger between the shoulder of the queen mother 
without a cri she fell 
i was quick by her side and the young maharajah and myself as we bent over her caught her die word 
all is well my belov son she murmur 
i have accomplish that which i was sent into the world to perform 
in peac i yield my soul to god 
with the last word she breath her last breath 
and such is mother love 
there was a suppress sob in more than one breast at the close of thepg 169 vener hakeem tale 
down his own furrow face the tear were stream 
and the woman who struck the foul blow 
inquir the afghan in an eager whisper 
the slave mother of the dead pretend 
well she too had given her all for mother love 
the tribesmen tore her limb from limb 
and the hakeem press a hand to his eye to shut out the memori of a dread scene

in the palac of the emperor was a magnific audienc hall with marbl column and stonecarv galleri in the centr of which stood the throne of gold sprinkl with rubi emerald and diamond surround by a silver railpg 2ing and cover by a canopi of rich crimson brocad 
in this audienc hall the great and good akbar was wont to receiv not onli his subject rich and poor the former assembl to pay their court the latter to lay their grievanc befor the imperi judg but he also extend welcom to stranger from afar 
on the question of religion his mind was at this period in a state of chang for he had broken from the strict faith of the moslem had public announc that there was good in all belief had overthrown ceremoni rule whether of islam or of hinduism and had proclaim all thing law except excess 
his thought thus drift toward a new religion a divin faith that would bring into one fold the votari of all religion he was glad at his court to give audienc to learn doctor from distant land as well as from everi part of india 
all were welcome—brahmin and buddhist moslem schoolmen hindu fanat pantheist the worshipp of fire the jew whose prophet are abraham and mose even christian padr from faroff europ 
it was akbar delight to listen to their exposit and discuss and to the defenc of their vari dogma 
thus did the fame of the king for toler benevol and wisdom becom nois abroad far and wide so that visitor flock in everincreas number to the beauti citi 
at our caravanserai without the gate there would often in the cool of an even be gather togeth on the shade veranda a group of travel repres divers racespg 3 and class 
some of the towndwel too would be there rest and refresh themselv after their walk to the citi wall while from the nearbi camp of the rajput who form a portion of the royal bodyguard there would oftentim stroll over a few menatarm 
on such occas it would general happen that the debat recent listen to in the imperi hall of assembl would be subject to comment 
and from discuss of this kind the convers would quit frequent chang to storytel dear to the heart of all nativ of hindustan and by no mean to be despis for in a good stori there may be implant the kernel of a sound philosophi 
on a summer night in the year name eight men were assembl on the veranda of the caravanserai 
the full moon had just risen abov a tope of tamarind tree and it silvern radianc reveal everi detail of the scene 
a rajput chief occupi the place of central promin cushion arrang for his conveni on one of which rest his scimitar the emblem of his soldier profess 
not far from him in a halfreclin postur was a general of the afghan also of the bodyguard of the emperor 
a hakeem or physician and an astrolog both in the moslem style of dress were seat close togeth leg cross beneath them while a littl apart were two hindus as the cast mark on their forehead show a taxcollector from the countri and a kotwal or citi magistr 
just abov the step lead on to the veranda surround by hispg 4 bale of merchandis sat a merchant from bombay a big and stalwart man attir in spotless white raiment on his head a volumin muslin turban 
in strike contrast squat on the ground below the step at his feet a wooden beg bowl was a fakir or religi ascet a loin cloth his sole cover his face bedaub with ash his lean chin rest on his uprais knee while he listen to the dialogu and watch each speaker face with eye of keen alert 
there had been some desultori convers which final result in the rajput chief be beg to relat in detail an experi at which he had previous hint 
the first stori led to anoth stori and the third to yet anoth and so on until each member of the compani had contribut to the general entertain 
and these are the tale that were told by the travel on the veranda of the caravanserai outsid the wall of fathpursikri that moonlight night in the day of the mighti akbar pg 5 i 
the maid of jhalnagor told by the rajput chief well sinc you would have it so listen to the stori of rukpur singh hereditari chief of jhalnagor mansabdar of five hundr men captain of the bodyguard of akbar the great king of king lord of the earth 
this day in the hall of assembl in the presenc of the great padishah himself we have listen to the argument of men of divers faith 
it is well 
as akbar the most high himself has said all religion are good each man has the god or god of his father let there be no obstacl place against worship the divin power in ani manner that seemeth fit 
that is both wisdom and justic 
that is whi i a hindu a rajput one of the twice born can serv my lord the moslem emperor akbar with loyalti of heart and of sword that no man may question 
at these word the captain of the bodyguard touch the jewel hilt of his scimitar lie on the cushion by his side 
he glanc around as if to see whether anyon present dare to question the fidel he had profess 
but there was neither movement nor remark among his listen and with a disdain littl smile of selfcomplac he resum 
dure today discuss in the spirit of toler that akbarpg 6 teach to all of us we rajput have had to harken to sever upbraid 
we are accus of inhuman becaus in our home a femal child may be done away with at birth law and without dishonour 
be it so the fact itself i shall not disput 
nor shall i defend the practic except to point out that a woman more or less in the world doe not matter that the babe suffer no pain and know no ill that had she live it might have been to a life of widowhood—if courag were want to choos the suttee—and therefor to long day of shame and sorrow 
furthermor has it to be rememb that the marriag of one of our daughter cost much money 
accord to the rule of our cast and the custom of our race the ceremoni must be worthi of the parent and of the posit they occupi all of the district must be feast and let the expens be grievous as it may it must be born 
to some who are rich the money thus spent is of no account 
but to other who are poor yet proud—and all rajput are proud—a wed that is seem for a daughter of the hous may mean poverti and ruin for the father and brother dure twenti year to follow 
in certain circumst this misfortun cannot be thought of 
the honour of the race the veri safeti of a whole clan may depend on rigid economi as a provis against danger 
so it may be both right and wise for an infant daughter to be put painless to her death 
such was the doctrin my father taught me and his name is bless 
the speaker drop his eye fold his hand across his breast andpg 7 for a full minut remain in silent medit 
when at last he look up again there had come over the usual stern and haughti face a wonder glow of kindli and his voic took a softer modul 
howev know this my friend that in my zenana at jhalnagor there are littl girls—thre and more will be welcom should the divin krishna send them 
three littl daughter have i all born of my wife lakmibai the jewel of jhalnagor 
with son also am i blessed—two brave littl boy of whom i may well be proud 
but i love them not more than my daughter nor would i chang ani one daughter for a son 
this do i say out of the truth of my heart and in no wise becaus fortun has been kind to me and mine and has given us such prosper that there is a fit dower for each daughter without my treasuri know the loss 
so when the learn mullah from stamboul denounc infanticid i was one with him in sympathi for my inclin is to cherish with love and care everi femal child the god send 
now would you hear how a rajput came to this manner of think 
my stori is that of a littl maid 
listen 
it happen just five year gone by 
under the firm and just rule of our master akbar there has been peac for mani year in our part of the world 
except when as now i come to fathpursikri for my year month of servic in providingpg 8 part of the emperor bodyguard i live quiet among my own peopl 
the soil around our villag is till our shopkeep buy and sell we worship in our templ and we are happi for no enemi come to disturb the peac of our beauti littl valley of jhalnagor embosom among the hill 
one day it befel that i had gone on a hunt trip with a parti of my friend 
in the earli dawn we had descend from the fort on the hill top which is my home and the rallyingplac for my clan—a small clan number but a few thousand but nobli born as ani tribe in rajputana brave and of honour unsulli men who have never yet given a daughter to the harem of a moslem 
the featur of the rajput flash with pride 
his brotheratarm the afghan met the defiant look and said with a quiet smile there are mani rajput women wed to moslem lord 
yes but not rajput women of jhalnagor 
they would have die first—mani of them did so prefer to die when the moslem host first swept over our land 
in the hour of defeat against overwhelm number within the citadel of jhalnagor the women of my race refus to accept dishonour bare their bosom to the spear of those they love husband brother and father and so they die 
with hand outstretch and eye uprais in rapt pride and rever for the deed of his ancestor again the rajput fell into momentari silenc 
the stori of the littl maid 
it was the voic ofpg 9 the physician recal the narrat to his task 
yes the stori of the littl maid resum the rajput 
as i have said we had gone to the hunt one morning—a parti of twelv ride on three eleph 
for we were in pursuit of a tiger a destroy of men which the villag had mark down in a patch of jungl by the river side 
of the hunt i need say noth we kill the tiger and with the huge stripe bodi slung across the neck of my eleph we were return home 
it was toward even for we had rest in the forest dure the heat of the day 
we were just enter the narrow gorg that lead to the fort on the hill when right on the pathway befor me i saw the prone figur of a child 
almost my eleph feet were upon it befor the sage brute himself stop and trumpet a warn to us in the howdah for the tiger bodi occupi the place where the mahout was wont to ride the latter was walk and he too had not notic the tini bundl of bright yellow cloth lie on the road 
glanc down i beheld a littl girl with her forehead touch the dust 
at my call she aros and spread her hand across her breast 
listen o chief to my warn listen o my lord she call out in a shrill tone of supplic 
alreadi had i observ that her face was one of great beauti although that of just a littl child but six or seven year old 
the other two eleph had halt behind minepg 10 and some of the parti had descend 
but at the approach of these men the maid shrank away and keep her eye fix in my direct she continu to address me listen to my word o chief and be save from death 
in anoth moment i had sprung to the ground 
as i advanc the child ran toward me absolut fearless 
take her in my arm i sat me down by the roadsid 
close to my breast she nestl and with sob and tear now told me her stori 
a robber band was in the nullah—less than a mile further along—ful a hundr strong fierc men and murder 
for they had alreadi slain the father and the mother of the littl maid humbl woodcutt 
i had known them well they were poor but of mine own peopl and instant in my heart i vow that i would be aveng 
the littl girl brenda her name as she told me in her childish way of confid had hidden in the brushwood all day trembl and afraid 
but at last she divin that the men had come to slay me for as the afternoon advanc they dispos themselv among bush and behind tree also in the hut of her dead parent 
and even now were the assassin in wait for me for the girl had seen our parti ride forth in the earli morn and she knew that i had not yet return 
when with wonder intuit for a child so tender in year the thought came to her mind that i was to be assail she stole down the gorg movingpg 11 cautious through the undergrowth and await at the spot we found her to give me warn 
the child had describ to me the leader of the gang and i had immedi recogn gunesh tanti accurs son of a pig a robber from across the desert of sindh who had more than onc ravag peac villag of rajputana 
he would know that i had treasur in the fort and of an instant i could read his wili plan 
move through the countri he had doubtless heard a day or two befor of this project expedit of mine for the kill of the maneat tiger 
so he had design to slay me on my homeward way and the deed accomplish would reli on gain access to the citadel by load his ruffian into the howdah of my eleph 
onc over the drawbridg and within the portcullis gateway his murder scheme might have been easi for my score of menatarm on duti would have been taken by surpris and so at a disadvantag 
but know now the danger i laugh in my beard for gunesh tanti this human tiger and slayer of innoc men just as had been the tiger now slung across the back of my eleph was fair deliv into my hand 
he who had come to trap me was himself entrap 
and thank all to this littl maid of the glen 
at the thought i pat her soft cheek with my hand and in respons she smile up into my eye with wondrous trust and winsom 
our parti as i have said number twelv thispg 12 without count the three mahout lith and activ men and brave as ani one of us 
the neck of the gorg was narrow and for a hundr yard on either side there were steep precipic down which rock could be tumbl on flee men 
by a goat path over the hillsid the fort could be reach by one sure of foot and know the way 
such a lad was of our parti a cousin of my own who could race with the deer 
in a few minut he had gird his loin and was on his mission disappear over the crest of the almost perpendicular crag up which he had clamber 
he was to warn the garrison turn out everi man and boy fulli arm and bid them to sweep down on the ambush robber 
the mother and the maiden would hold the fort 
no other garrison when onc on the alert was need for such an enemi 
again the rajput smile proud but the silenc of intent listen was unbroken and he continu the fire of a matchlock was to be our signal that my men held the upper end of the pass and were descend on our enemi 
meanwhil my immedi follow prepar the rock abov the narrow neck of the defil and got them readi for instant roll down 
to this last task four of our number were deput 
the other abid with me 
our plan was to block the narrow passag by rang the eleph abreast of each other and so that the anim themselv might not be stamped by the unexpect din of battl we chain their forelegspg 13 first each anim separ and then the middl one to his comrad on either side 
at last all our prepar were complet the huge beast in line my companion mount into the howdah 
i alon remain on foot i and the littl woodcutt daughter stand by my side hold trust to my hand and no longer weep 
you must come with me my almondsweet i said as i rais the child in my arm and pass her up into the howdah of my own eleph the central one 
then i myself clamber aloft 
the tiger corps had been flung to the ground and our three mahout sat in their proper place iron goad in hand readi to perform their task of keep the eleph under control 
at last after a tens period of wait the welcom report of the matchlock reverber from among the hill 
the fight doe not realli concern my stori said the rajput grim 
it is suffici to say that gunesh tanti and all his band perish to a man—som slain by the sword of my horsemen charg down the pass some crush by the fall rock some of the last survivor who flung themselv desper against our live barrier die on our handpik or be trampl under foot by the eleph 
not one of more than five score men live to carri back the tale of death to the robber haunt whenc they had come 
on our side some live were lost seven in all but this is the penalti that brave men have to pay in thepg 14 do of righteous deed 
their memori is honour 
as for the littl maid i had nest her in the bestprotect corner of the howdah and in the thick of the fray when a shower of arrow had fallen upon us i had cover her tini form with my shield 
but dure the final handtohand fight when all was din and turmoil with the shout of the men and the angri trumpet of the eleph i had not paid her ani special heed 
from her lip came no sound to attract my attention—no cri of fear nor wail murmur 
but at the end i look for the littl child lift the shield that had part guard her 
she met my gaze with a smile 
but straightway i notic that an arrow descend almost perpendicular had pierc her soft littl arm and transfix it to her side 
yet had she not cri out nor even now when i was tend her did she whimper 
i drew forth the arrow break it in twain so as to let the shaft pass through the arm 
although blood flow freeli i saw at a glanc that the wound in the bodi was a mere punctur and also that on the limb onli a pierc of the flesh 
therefor was her hurt not serious although of a certainti pain and terrifi too for a child so young 
but even now not one word of complain did she utter 
she kept her sweet smile on me 
brave littl maid 
tear a length of cambric from my turban i had bound both arm and tender breast and readjust the sari of yellowdi cotton that form herpg 15 simpl garment 
and now she repos happi and content in my arm 
i remain in the howdah while my companion cut off the head of the robber and load these trophi of victori on one of the other eleph so that a triumphal pile might be made in the courtyard of the citadel 
then with the tiger replac on the neck of my own eleph we move for home a group of fifti horsemen now form our escort 
the headless bodi of our enemi were left as fit spoil for the jackal and the vultur the latter of whom scent the carrion were alreadi begin to drop down it might seem from the blue vault of heaven 
by the time we gain the fortress the dusk was gather 
across the drawbridg prompt lower at the sound of our joy shout i saw my wife stand besid the big carronad that command the roadway up the hill 
the smoke match was in her hand but at sight of me she stoop and smother in the dust the spark that would have dealt out death to the robber had they ever gain a near approach 
descend from my eleph i greet her and thank her for the courag of herself and all the other women our love one 
then my friend abov hand down gentl into my arm the form of the littl maid 
at sight of my wife sweet and kind counten the eye of the child were light with joyous 
but with a quick motion wife drew her veil complet over her featur 
ere this was done howev i had caught a strang look in her face—a look of mingl surpg 16prise and terror 
at the same moment her old attend and confid rakaya flung herself at my feet and began to babbl for my forgiv 
what mean this 
i ask glanc in profound amaz from the woman prostrat form up into my wife eye 
there again i read the strang troubl express 
puzzl yet restrain my curios befor the other gather around i place the wound child in my wife arm and with a gestur to signifi that she and rakaya were to follow i led the way to the women quarter 
onc within the zenana i told my stori briefli how the littl damsel of the glen had save me from certain death and then through danger and through pain had been brave as the noblestborn rajput maid could be 
after this recit i commend the child to my wife affect bid her love the orphan as she would a daughter 
then was the love counten of my wife the jewel of jhalnagor suffus with great joy 
hug the child to her mother bosom she exclaim ii 
the hollow column told by the taxcollector everi man fate is foreordain said the taxcollector reflect stroke his beard 
although we may not understand it at the moment each particular event that happen is simpli a mean prepar for some destin end that may be mani year remot in time 
vishnu the preserv save the life of the littl maid of jhalnagor so that her father life might later on be save 
but none can read the futur so that we are all blind do the thing of today without know their real bear on the thing of a faraway tomorrow 
and one man can make or mar the happi of anoth man even though their live be separ by hundr of leagu in space or hundr of year in time 
in your mind doubtless is some tale to illustr the truth of what you teach remark the astrolog with a shrewd uplift of his eyebrow 
the star can help us to read the futur as i can prove to you by a stori of actual experi 
but befor i proceed to my narrat pray friend let us hear from you 
glad assent the taxcollector 
the stori of this nobl rajput has brought to memori an incid in my own life mani year ago likewis servingpg 20 to show that the god prepar long year ahead for the work out of each particular man destini 
listen as a youth i was a keeper of account in the servic of a rich zemindar whose estat lay in the countri of the five river 
he was a usur as well as a landown as had been his father befor him for mani generat 
so in his castl was an accumul of great store of wealth—gold and silver and precious stone cloth of gold silk brocad and muslin ivori and amber camphor spice dye stuff and other merchandis of diver kind 
the afghan general stir and the scabbard of his sword rattl on the floor as rais himself from his elbow that rest on a cushion he sat up and assum an attitud of keen attent 
where is this place 
he ask a wolfish gleam in his eye and his lip curv to a smile that reveal under the black curl moustach the white gleam of sharppoint teeth 
the storytel also smile know and rais a deprecatori hand 
nay friend this zemindar my first master was not fate to be reliev of his treasur as my stori will tell even though a skil plot had been laid for his spoliat 
which is the veri point of my tale although i may seem to come to it by a roundabout way of tell 
the afghan sank back on his cushion but his gaze remain rivet on his narrat face 
one day i was seat in my home cast up my book of account for ipg 21 had onli that morn complet the take of tax from the crop of the rayat the tenant of my lord 
all of a sudden a whiterob figur enter the doorway and threw himself prostrat befor me 
when at last the face was rais i recogn the dhobi of the villag that nestl under the hill on which was perch the castl of the zemindar 
o thou washer of cloth i ask what is thi plaint 
protector of the poor repli my visitor behold my bandag feet beaten with rod until they are swollen and torn 
i look as request and saw the bloodstain soak through the wrap of linen 
thou art an honest and a peac man bhagwan 
whi this cruel punish 
i know not inde 
but i have come to thee becaus i have endur the wrong at the hand of thi master 
tell me thi stori 
as you have said o my protector began the dhobi assum a sit postur and spread the fold of his looseflow cotton garment over his bandag feet i am an honest man 
and it is for that veri reason i have suffer 
yesterday among the apparel i receiv from the home of the zemindar to be made clean and white was the bodic of a woman and tie in one corner of this piec of raiment was a ring set with bright red stone thatpg 22 gleam as if they were aflam 
straightway i return to the palac of the zemindar and enter the audienc chamber where as is his wont at that particular hour each day he was seat receiv the complaint of the oppress did my humbl obeis and then place in his hand the jewel i had discov 
he ask me where i had found it and when i repli truth his eye flash with anger and his voic thunder at me in rebuk 
although i had done no wrong but rather a virtuous deed i implor for pardon 
but in vain 
my mind grew confus and the next thing i rememb was the sharp cut of bamboo rod upon the sole of my feet 
i was in a small vault chamber bound to a wooden bench surround by the zemindar soldier and powerless except to scream out in the agoni of each blow 
thirti stroke were count and then i was flung out of the gate of the castl to limp my way home 
tear of selfpiti were in the dhobi eye as he recount his tale of woe 
even then i was reflect on the real caus of the zemindar wrath 
the jewel had been discov in the fold of a garment worn by one of the women in his zenana and his quick access of anger show that the gift had come from some other hand than his 
savag jealousi therefor had prompt the act of injustic inflict upon the unfortun washerman 
i knew my master so well his sullen mood his outburst of passion that alreadi i could arriv at this conclus with certainti 
proceed i said indiffer for it is well that apg 23 man should keep his own counsel in such delic affair 
what is my concern with your misfortun 
harken o dispens of bounti 
last night when i lay nurs my wound i rememb that the ring which had prove the caus of my miseri had been wrap in a fragment of paper whereon were some strang mark and line as in the book of learn men 
this i had flung away at that time deem onli the ring to be of ani consequ 
but the thought came to me in the night that perhap the paper might tell someth about the ring 
so all this day have i search among the bush by the stream where i beat the cloth on stone and wash them 
and behold i have found that for which i have been seek 
hereupon the dhobi loosen the loin cloth beneath his upper garment and extract from it fold a tini roll of paper 
this he present to me with a bow of defer to my superior understand of such thing 
this time i have come to you he said a man of learn and of justic not like unto the cruel zemindar 
doe the paper tell whi i should have suffer such shame and pain at his hand 
i had unrol the scroll the fold of which show that it had serv as a wrap for the ring 
the write was in neat persian charact and i had no difficulti in deciph it for the four line that met my eye had been recit to me onli a few day befor by the veri man who claim to be their author 
now did my veri heart trembl with agit 
pg 24 but to the dhobi i appear cold as the water of the snow that melt on the mountain 
this write would onli add to your troubl i said 
here let me destroy it 
and turn to the red ash burn in a brazier near at hand i dexter substitut a fragment of paper on which i had been figur my account for the paper receiv from the dhobi place the former on the glow charcoal ember and bestow the latter in the secur of my girdl 
a curl of white smoke a puff of flame and the work of destruct was to all appear complet 
in view of your misfortun my friend i resum i bestow upon you in the name of my master ten maund of dal which will be sent to your home on the morrow 
the recipi of this unexpect bounti prostrat himself befor me 
o princ of justic no longer do my wound pain me 
the belli of my children will be fill for mani long day to come 
then go thi way rejoic in thi heart even though limp on thi feet 
and rememb that silenc is golden 
say not one word more to anyon about the ring or the paper your punish or the reward that has now redress the wrong 
go in peac 
and the dhobi after profus express of gratitud hobbl from my presenc 
alon with my thought i felt sore troubl 
the writer of the vers of ardent poetri written onpg 25 the paper brought to me by the washerman was my cherish friend a youth from faraway bokhara abdul by name 
this young man had come to our countri onli a year or so befor bring sever beauti arab hors for sale 
these the zemindar had purchas and had retain abdul in his servic for the youth was skill in the manag of hors and in the rear of young stock 
abdul and myself were much of an age and my regul of expenditur in the stabl had brought us constant togeth 
so a close friendship had result valu great on my side for i had soon come to know that abdul was a man of refin and learn such as i had never befor encount in ani man of so humbl a call 
and despit the fact that he was a moslem and i a hindu he had chosen me as his intim friend his onli confid 
thus had it come about that at time he had read to me of an even song of his own compos and even on occas had sung them to the accompani of a small harp the string of which he touch with wondrous skill and sensibl 
now did i know that this dear friend of mine had endang not onli iii 
what the star ordain told by the astrolog and now master stargaz your proffer stori said the taxcollector bestir the compani from it medit mood 
as i have promis respond the astrolog i shall recount an experi that show how the star if read aright can tell us the influenc for good or for evil that weigh upon a man and inevit determin his destini at the critic moment of his life 
what is written is written and it is imposs to strive against fate 
nay object the rajput that is a teach of helpless to which i cannot subscribe—th piti excus of the coward who fold his hand in the hour of danger or of the selfindulg weakl who yield to seduct temptat becaus his heart inclin to seiz the pleasur of the moment even when his conscienc counsel otherwis 
i hold that man is the master of his own fate 
most assur have i been the master of mine he ad with a proud smile his finger close signific on the handl of a dagger at his belt 
be it so answer the astrolog 
but as allah know everyth that is to happen so must it happen 
which doe not forbid the exercis of my own free will argu thepg 36 rajput 
the suprem be the presid power of creation call him allah if you will understand my heart as he understand all thing know beforehand what choic of action i shall make at the moment of an emerg 
but that still leav me respons for the deed which i elect to do 
such is my understand of destini 
it give foreknowledg to god but leav free will to man 
from all of which i do not dissent rejoin the astrolog 
it is onli the ignor or the base that make kismet the excus for helpless or for wrongdo 
but as the star under which a man is born influenc that man act then doe the read of the star guid us as to what the futur has in store 
i know littl about your star repli the rajput 
but let us have the stori he ad cross his hand on his knee in an attitud of expect 
the astrolog salut his audienc general with a bow of acquiesc thus began by your courtesi let me first explain as necessari to the understand of the tale which is to follow that i am from persia from the citi of teheran where for mani generat my ancestor were profound student of astrolog some of them famous men becaus of their skil divin with reput that reach even to stamboul 
for thither in my earli boyhood to the court of the sultan of the osman was my father summon and him i neverpg 37 beheld again 
it was from my age grandfath that i learn my first lesson in astrology—about the twelv hous the rule star of each day the come and the go of the planet their conjunct and opposit and the influenc they exercis on men live 
i learn with avid and was an apt pupil for at fifteen i had begun the practic of my profess cast horoscop and read the nocturn heaven with constant care understand also the flight of bird and the cri of wild beast of the jungl 
yet at that time was my mind assail with grievous doubt 
i often caught myself wonder whether the star did realli rule the fate of men 
and with this inward question a restless spirit grew upon me 
i long to see more of the world—to enlarg the sphere of my observ 
just then i chanc to hear some gossip in the bazaar about a great expedit that was get readi at kabul to descend upon hindustan 
the hunger of adventur seiz me and was not to be deni 
despit the tear and implor of my famili i set forth on foot for afghanistan a stripl in my hand the staff i use in my divin in the bag slung at my side a singl chang of raiment 
money i had none but my abil to read the star i knew well would earn me a livelihood wherev i might wander 
with my adventur dure the next two year this stori has no concern 
it is enough to say that after mani vicissitud of fortun i found myself instal as astrolog in the court of a moslempg 38 princ sovereign over an extens region in kashmir 
my lord was a man of nobl heart and of high mental gift 
he rule over his peopl not by fear of the sword but by absolut justic which he himself person administ everi day hold audienc so that grievanc even those of the most poor might be heard and wrong redress 
and his royal duti were share by his wife who although she might sit behind the screen of the women quarter none the less share in the counsel of state and contribut word of wisdom in the direct of affair 
never in my experi have i encount such mutual love trust and devot as subsist between this pair 
for no other woman in the world had mirza shah thought or regard or desire—i call him mirza shah but that was not his real name 
for reason that will present appear i refrain from disclos the ident of place and person connect with my stori 
well it was my privileg from the outset to be on relat of close intimaci with my master 
he use to come through the palac garden to the shrubembow tower which i occupi and from the roof of which i night contempl the heaven 
for long hour he would abid with me learn someth of the star while enjoy the cool of the night air after the heat and fatigu of the day 
and mani time of an afternoon the sultana veil would come with her lord and togeth they wouldpg 39 seek to gain from me knowledg of the heaven bodi and of divin 
some thing i told to them but other i withheld which is just and right for skill in astrolog is hereditari descend from father to son and new mind are unprepar for such teach so that too much knowledg convey to outsid may becom a sourc of disturb to themselv and perchanc of danger and hurt to their fellow men 
thus follow the rule laid down for me by my grandfath alway even when close press with question did i exercis a discreet reserv 
gradual the friendship accord to me by my lord and his ladi wax stronger and i found myself be admit to some of their innermost thought 
thus did i come to learn the passion long of the wife to becom a mother for six year had she wait but no child had bless her love for her husband 
as for mirza shah just so soon as the subject was mention i could see the cloud of melancholi rest on his brow 
and when as time went on sad seem to settl upon him continu i knew full well that this disappoint in his wed life had at last taken complet possess of his mind to the exclus of all other matter 
and from the sultana manner i could see the trepid that fill her heart—th dread that her childless might in the end rob her of her husband love 
it was not given to me to look upon her face—to get more than a glimps of her eye as they shot an occasion glanc at me through the part foldspg 40 of her veil 
but in these glanc i had read the prayer of entreati that i should use all the spell of my art in her favour so as to obtain for her from god the gift of a son 
well after a time an unexpect thing happen 
mirza shah was absent from his home—gon on a full week journey engag in the settl of some disput on the confin of his territori 
to me there came one afternoon the sultana attend by one of her women—th most trust one i knew for both were from the same countri near to amritsar where the famous rug are woven 
so much i had learn and this further i also knew that by birth the sultana was a hindu although on be wed to her lord as a littl girl she had of cours embrac the true faith of islam in so far as it matter for a woman to have ani religion at all 
it was the femal attend who spoke to me her mistress listen in silenc 
but the question came so readili that it was clear the lesson had been well rehears by the twain 
astrolog she began can you swear on the koran that the star speak truth 
that i can swear i repli with due digniti and respect for myself and my profess 
can the star bring about the wish of man or of woman 
nay that i do not declar 
they rule the live of men and women onli in so far as their movement forecast the futur 
if we can read the star aright we may gain foreknowledg of event destin topg 41 happen 
for what is written in the scroll of fate cannot be chang 
from kismet there is no escap 
then tell me this o astrolog from your star is my nobl ladi here ever go to have a child a son 
that question i cannot answer 
unless i have the horoscop of her high cast by skill hand at the time of her birth i cannot tell which planet rule her destini 
ala we knew not these thing among my peopl down in amritsar i heard my ladi murmur 
bah 
exclaim the serv woman contemptu 
she had flung open her veil unasham as are women of her station that i not her brother or her husband should gaze upon her face 
it was a pleasant enough face of a woman of fiveandtwenti year of age yet methought as i look into it now that there was unseem bold in her eye and even someth of wanton abandon in her manner 
bah 
if your star cannot get us what we wish what good are they 
better pray at a hindu shrine to krishna god of love revel than wast time in consult a moslem astrolog 
that is what i have said all along dear ladi and with undoubt great affect the woman fold to her breast her now sob mistress 
i turn away as was proper and busi myself with a chart of the heaven over which i had been pore when my visitor had arriv 
on again rais my eye i found that i was alon 
this incid i had well nigh forgotten and near a year had elaps 
for some month i had not seenpg 42 the sultana she remain in the strict seclus of the harem 
her high was unwel most peopl said 
but i knew the truth mirza shah himself had told it to me his face beam with pride and pleasur 
at last his dearest hope were to be realiz the sultana was about to becom a mother 
iv 
the spirit wail told by the merchant allah alon can search the heart of men said the hakeem slowli and reflect repeat the word with which the astrolog had close his tale 
he was a man of vener appear with flow white beard that descend to his waist 
and yet although his face was furrow with the line of old age his eye were wonder youth in their contempl calm 
no truer word have been spoken tonight he continu 
yet must we further reflect that while a man cannot sit in judgment upon his fellow he can assur judg himself which goe to show that within the breast of everi man there dwell the veri spirit of god the power to search his own heart whether in condemn or for approv 
life is a problem and it requir a full lifetim to solv it 
onli as we grow older do we come to know our own souls—our strength and our weak the measur of our true nobil of charact and likewis the measur of our inher mean the temptat not mere from without but from within that assail us our power to conquer these or our miser yield at time with no one perhap even guess at our degrad except the divin spark ofpg 61 conscienc that inexor turn a search ray on everi thought and on everi motiv for action 
so you would argu that man is god 
queri the rajput 
not so but that the soul of man is of the essenc of god the proof of which is this veri power of search out our own heart and sit in judgment on our own fail for the judgment seat belong to allah alon 
a subtl philosophi which i do not presum fulli to understand interpos the merchant from bombay 
dure the night entertain he had shown himself to be a man of few word yet an attent listen 
he was of middl age of a mild digniti of mien and of robust physiqu as befit one accustom to long journey through region infest with robber or with beast of prey 
but in my practic experi of life he proceed i have come to realiz that while i may know myself no other man can i know 
therefor if it be right to be spare of condemn for anoth it is also wise to be chari of undu commend 
the world too often acclaim a deed as nobl when the real motiv prompt it is utter ignobl 
a true philosoph despit your bale of merchandis murmur the hakeem with a smile nod of approv for the sentiment express 
well i suppos that everi one who travel becom a philosoph more or less assent thepg 62 trader 
chang of scene and of companionship stimul new idea 
now will i relat an actual experi which apt illustr that in our deal with those around us we never realli penetr their mind 
man know himself he know no one else—friend or intim the child of his heart or the veri wife of his bosom 
it is more easi to discov a white crow mutter the fakir than know what a woman has in her heart 
the merchant paid no heed to the interrupt 
he went on each of us is an inscrut mysteri to the other 
each soul is veil to everi other soul and is nake to itself alon 
o princ of philosoph in pedlar disguis 
murmur the hakeem 
if our soul sat nake for the common gaze comment the rajput if we could all read each other heart then inde would life be an abomination—an utter miseri with the twin devil of shame and disgust seat at our elbow all the time 
most true concur the trader 
for too much knowledg of anoth inmost thought bring onli disillusion and regret as my tale will show 
the stori take us among humbl peopl but human natur is the same everywhere—th same in the hut of the rayat as in the palac of the rajah 
onc in everi two year it is my custom to travel from bombay to benar and invari i breakpg 63 the journey at a certain villag some six or seven day from my final destin 
here dwell an old friend and cast brother former like myself a merchant in the bombay bazaar where silken stuff are sold but retir now to his own countri with modest save suffici for the rest of his day 
baji lal as he is name is all the closer to me becaus his wife devaka is a sister of my own wife and the two are alway eager to have news of each other welfar 
at the hous of this friend i rest for a day or two enjoy his companionship the reminisc of old time and the gossip of the hour 
so on my long and fatigu journey i have alway look forward to these meet with pleasur anticip and rememb them with tranquil satisfact 
but on the occas of one of my period visit judg of my surpris when i was receiv in silenc and with apathi that made no pretenc at disguis 
devaka did not rise from her cushion on the floor to bid me welcom and her husband similar irrespons return my customari cordial greet with noth better than a look of weari deject 
disturb i made inquiri baji lal my friend what is the matter 
are you ail 
but he onli shook his head and turn away 
to devaka i then appeal 
what is the mean of this 
i ask 
sad and silenc where everyth use to be joy 
she drew asid the sari that had conceal her face and i was shockedpg 64 at it griefstricken aspect 
her trembl lip part to answer me but her husband check her with a sharp word such as i had never heard him use to her befor 
her eye fill with tear and i could see the big drop roll down her cheek as she silent replac the sari over her head and bend low rock herself to and fro 
for the moment i imagin that i had intrud on some scene of domest unhappi which would be dissip in an hour 
so hide my embarrass i turn to the door intim that i would seek some other lodg for the night and return on the morrow when i hope my friend would be in fitter mood to receiv me 
at last baji lal spoke rais his face but still remain seat on the divan we were wont in former time to share 
go thi way chunda das he said 
the sword of fate has descend upon this hous 
come not again to a place accurs 
then did i realiz that the troubl was serious 
but my friend and brother i protest i cannot depart and leav you thus 
let me at least understand what calam has befallen you so that i may help toward it repair 
noth can be done so noth need be said he answer in a tone and with a look of dignifi resign to the will of god 
if you must have the stori of our misfortun you have onli to ask the first of our neighbour you encount 
and he too cover his face with his garment leav me no choicepg 65 but to withdraw without further attempt at this manifest inopportun time to probe the mysteri 
if i was to be of servic to my friend howev knowledg of what had befallen was the first essenti 
so i took the road that would lead me to the great pipul tree in the villag squar close to the tank and to the templ where all day long there was come and go and where therefor i would be most like to glean the inform i desir 
by a happi chanc i found reclin under the pipul tree the villag barber a loquaci fellow who count it as part of his busi to know the last detail about other peopl affair 
after greet and a few remark about the weather and the crop and the season epidem i care broach the real purpos of my interview for a prudent man will never divulg his thought to anoth until he know that other thought 
i have just come from the hous of baji lal i said in a seem casual way 
the barber face instant lost the smile it had worn 
how did you find him 
he ask 
strang alter i repli 
and so doe everi one he concur 
whi so 
i ventur 
the barber look at me squar and then said you and he were veri good friend chunda das 
yes and are still so far as i am concern i answer 
pg 66 i thought so 
well i am his friend likewis 
mani year i have known him and his wife devaka 
both are good kind peopl alway will to help their neighbour and readi to give their last bowl of rice to a vagrant beggar 
perhap you can assist me to clear away the shadow that have fallen around them and obscur the sunshin of their home 
let me tell you the stori 
a few month ago a stranger came to this villag 
he was on his way to fathpursikri to wit the glori of the court of the mighti akbar 
but on the road he had fallen ill and arriv here was too sick to proceed 
i am asham to say that none of us were will to take him in for sick goe from one person to anoth 
so we have to be care especi in my call where i come into such close contact with so mani 
there was quit a littl crowd just here by the tank discuss the situat the sick man in their midst rest upon the ground when baji lal and his wife who happen to be pass came forward to see what the commot was all about 
they listen to the stori and then told the stranger he might come with them 
he grate accept and after whisper some instruct to a servant by whom he was accompani he motion to baji lal to lead the way 
the littl group move off the servant in the rear lead the hors which includ a pack anim laden with the travel bed cook pot and other belong 
v the blue diamond told by the fakir you have certain improv on the moral of my stori said the astrolog address the merchant silent now after the tell of his tale 
if it is for god alon to pronounc the censur on mankind then assur it is for god also to award the prais 
as the stori of sheikh ahm and his jewel harp well show deed may be done open by the hand but the motiv for their do lie secret in the heart 
and the heart is the innermost templ where none but the high priest the individu soul hold communion with his god the suprem deiti of the univers 
so that a man life is an unsolv riddl to all but himself concur the hakeem 
and not to be solv even by himself remark the afghan with a laugh half of bitter half of bravado 
we may know in our secret heart the motiv that prompt to a deed but we cannot tell the consequ of that deed as affect even ourselv who wrought it 
take this veri stori of the sheikh when recov his precious harp he was but dig his own grave 
so with all of us we imagin we are march brave to accomplish some preconceiv plan when all the time we are merelypg 102 grope with blind eye along the path of destini avoid the mud hole it may be but fail to see the tiger crouch for his spring a few pace further along 
shabash 
cri the fakir in a shrill tone of approv that drew all eye to the lean and nake and ashbesprinkl figur seat at the foot of the veranda step 
shabash 
shabash 
he cri again and yet again 
and your stori 
ask the rajput with a nod of inquiri and encourag 
is one that show how a man may keep on run all his life yet never reach the goal he has in sight repli the ascet 
and with the sturdi independ of his call he beat a peremptori tattoo with fingertip on wooden beggingbowl to command attent to his tale 
behold in me a man who possess noth in this world except a beggingbowl and a loin cloth 
yet was i at one time the owner of land and of cattl of a home bounti store for comfort and for susten of wive who wore rich jewel necklet of pearl armlet of gold and bangl of silver with maidserv to minist to their need and children to play around them 
all gone 
by my own do or undo call it which you will 
and know too that in those day i also was a soldier—thi with a defiant glanc first at the rajput chief and then at the afghan general 
at my side rattl the steel scabbard and in my beltpg 103 was the sharp poinard swift messeng of death when it came to handtohand fight and the hors i rode had it rich trap of gold and silver 
it may all seem strang to hear me tell those thing of the long ago and to look upon me now—and the speaker stretch forth his skinni twist finger and attenu arm and for a moment ruefulli contempl them 
but i speak the truth he went on for tonight prompt by the stori to which i have listen and the thought they have engend will i unseal my lip after fifti long year of wander alon give no man my confid seek no man confid intent onli on the attain of the one desir deepli seat in my heart and which in my eager strive to achiev seem to be ever more remot from accomplish 
tonight will i reveal the stori of my life so that perchanc the lesson it teach will show still more clear the impot of man to constitut himself the aveng of wrong 
for if judgment belong to allah so doe vengeanc 
and the choic of instrument of time and place of the veri manner of the deed—al this belong to god alon as this night listen to the stori that have gone befor have i for the first time come fulli to comprehend 
the fakir paus to gaze around his audienc 
the look of interest and expect on each face show the impress his impuls flow of languag had made 
no interrupt word was spoken but everi eye remain fasten on the lean keen face peeringpg 104 over long slender shank and handclasp knee 
the narrat continu in those day i had twenti retain at my call and these men i command when i rode forth to servic with a certain nawab from whom i held my land for the feudal servic i thus perform 
it was my fate to take part in mani a fight and in mani a foray and to send mani a man to his doom 
but god had ordain it so the fault was not mine 
well it befel that a certain citi was given over to sack and carnag for the word had gone forth that the onli way to break the power of it hindu occup was to demolish their templ destroy their idol and therebi show the impot of their fals god to protect them 
the rajput drew himself up proud and a flush of resent stole over his face 
but the moslem fanat unconsci now of anyth but his reminisc of the past went on unheed and unabash it was toward the hour of sunset when a bodi of our soldieri broke into a templ devot to the worship of siva the destroy 
we had batter in the heavi wooden door that protect the inner court and within the threshold a score or more of priest fell to our sword and a dozen danc girl as well attend on the idols—selfslain these women for when they saw that there was no quarter for the men they rush on us like femal panther and flung themselv on our drip blade 
the hindu listen were visibl disturb and afpg 105fect by this cold recit of bloodi deed 
the hand of the rajput clench and unclench themselv nervous and the merchant gave a deep guttur groan of horror as he flung the end of his robe over his face as if to shut out a vision of sacrileg and shame 
it was written in the begin nay befor creation it was written murmur the moslem astrolog quot in courteous sympathi the familiar formula of his faith 
and as your priest themselv say he ad address himself more particular to the rajput the destini of each man is irrevoc inscrib on his forehead by the hand of brahma himself 
the rajput bow his head in acquiesc silenc and as the fakir proceed with his stori the trader also regain his composur and withdrew the cover from his face 
when the shadow of night fell the templ made a bonfir that illumin the scene of pillag go on all around 
the big idol of loath aspect had been thrown down broken to piec and despoil of their jewel and the heavi plate of gold that encumb them 
our soldier had swarm out of the build past a tank to the hous of some priest beyond 
not one singl custodian of the templ surviv and i stood alon in the outer courtyard watch in idl fashion the tongu of flame lick the beam and rafter and paintbedaub wall of the wreck edific 
then did my eye chanc to light on a small idolpg 106 in the passageway between the two courtyard of the templ set in a deep nich on which account it had escap the notic of the despoil 
it was the familiar elephanthead idol of the hindus ganapati as i knew they call him their god of wisdom and the remov of obstacl accord to their creed 
even as i look methought that the eye of the idol twinkl know and entreat at me 
after a moment i saw that this fanci was but due to the play of the flame on jewel comprehend which i said to myself that the littl fat man might perchanc be of some consider valu 
so i pluck him from his restingplac not without difficulti for the base of the idol was fasten by iron clamp to the altar and onli just in time befor a surg of fire and smoke swept through the vestibul 
then without more ado i carri forth this ganapati wrap in a cotton cloth i had gather from one of the slain priest and tie it to the saddlebow of my hors which had been stand tether under a tree close at hand 
thus did it come about that a full month later i was seat in my home in a secret inner chamber that serv me as a treasuri and to which the onli access was through the women quarter 
and befor me on a stool rest the crossleg figur of the fourarm and elephanthead god fat complac smile to all appear recov from the fatigu of a journey of near a hundr leagu and thorough content amidst his new surroundpg 107ing 
the idol was of bronz and the eye which at time gave it such lifelik semblanc were cluster of rubi set around with white sapphir 
and it follow that day after day after the siesta hour i found myself in the compani of this accurs idol—for accurs it came to be bring me misfortun and ruin as my stori will unfold 
no doubt it was by my own do that the wrath of allah was brought down upon my head 
for had not i a follow of the prophet and therefor a despis of graven imag in everi shape or form come to treat this monstrous and misshapen creatur half man half beast as a sort of familiar even greet him on my entri with the word with which i might have salut a live unbeliev may your day be peac spoken in goodnatur jest of cours and without one thought at the time of the sacrileg of which i was guilti 
yea i would pat the fat littl fellow on the head and when the humour seiz me would show him my hoard of gold mohur even jingl befor him a bag of silver rupe or ask his opinion on the colour and qualiti of some gem speak word of foolish the while like a child play with a toy 
and when i lay back on my cushion sometim i fanci that the littl jewel eye in the eleph head of bronz twinkl at me in merri and friend understand 
all which thing i have sinc rememb with bitter shame 
vi 
the tiger of the pathan told by the afghan general in my case the philosophi of life is of the simplest remark the afghan general 
i neither crave the wealth of the princ nor do i inflict upon myself the mortif of the ascet 
for the one rich robe and the sceptr for the other a loin cloth and a beggingbowl but for me the good sword that command respect from my enemi confid from my friend and my due share of the good thing of exist 
in this frame of mind i find the full measur of joy in each day that pass 
he smile the smile of the man content with the world and with himself but there was the light of proud determin in his eye that beli the mere sybarit 
then for you the greatest good consist in the happi you can snatch from the pass hour suggest the magistr 
that is so concur the soldier if to the word happi you give the right interpret 
to me the perform of one present duti is the onli real thing that bring content 
and duti need not alway be stern and forbid to laugh and play and be merri may at the proper time and in the proper circumst be a duti both to ourselvespg 129 and to other 
when one live philosoph for the present he take men in all their mood and life in all it phase 
the past is count as dead and to be forgotten except for the experi gain to guid the do of the thing that lie now to one hand 
the futur is unseen but is none the less determin by our deed word and thought of the pass moment each one of which be it rememb whether deed or rash word or unspoken thought has consequ that are etern 
so for the man whose mind is thus attun again interpos the magistr the present becom all suprem shape by the past shape the futur 
which mean that destini never degener into mere blind and helpless fatal respond the afghan 
to do the right now suffic to give absolut trust in god for the hereaft 
that is the key of destini and each man hold it in his own keep 
a simpl religion smile the rajput 
and therefor the best 
it is the religion of islam freed from all the controversi of rival sect and overlearn mullah 
it is the religion of my father and the religion of my youth and in it i abid 
let me tell you a stori of the rough school in which i receiv my earli train and where such thought as these first began to sink deep into my mind 
have you ever heard of shir jumla khan 
no 
well that is doubtless becaus he has been dead for a full score of year and becaus he held his sway in a land remot from these plain of hindustan uppg 130 in the rug mountain where brave tribesmen guard the valley which their ancestor till and yield allegi to no one but their own hereditari chieftain 
such was my countri and my peopl for i am proud that in my vein run the blood of the man who for a hundr mile around my boyhood home was known as the tiger of the pathan 
behold in me a grandson of shir jumla khan 
the narrat fold his arm across his breast in an attitud of quiet digniti 
after just a moment paus he continu we were all born fighter the member of my clan for dure hundr of year mani a swarm host had swept past the gateway of our territori persian arab afghan mogul turkman hord of fight men of everi race and tongu sometim march south bent on conquest at other time return to their home laden with rich spoil and yet at other time defeat and broken with enemi press at their heel 
and it was the patrimoni right of our tribe to take toll from all alik from victor and vanquish from pursuer and pursu 
sometim an armi would pass through our mountain under safe conduct from all the tribe and the price paid in money hors camel and cattl cloth and other good would be divid among the sever clan 
but in this practic there had grown to be more danger for ourselv than from foray or assault on pass enemi becaus over the divis of the spoil there would bepg 131 quarrel follow by fight among the tribe 
thus had origin mani a blood feud endur through mani generat 
in the earli day of shir jumla khan it had come about that sever rich caravan had fallen exclus into his hand 
with the money thus provid by the bounti of allah he had been enabl to build for himself a citadel that for vast and secur surpass those of all his rival among the tribal chief 
within it wide wall were well and water tank garden for the grow of fruit and veget warehous for good granari store with barley wheat and dal stabl for a hundr hors shed for the hous of cattl sheep and camel and dwell place for a good multitud of arm men their wive and their children 
and all of these thing endur until this day for the fortress town amid the mountain built by my grandsir the tiger of the pathan has ever remain unconqu and unconquer 
but as shir jumla khan grew rich in possess and in power—for score of fight men from afar were attract to his service—at the same time did his posit among the tribesmen becom one of increas isol 
all fear him and envi him and fear and envi have ever been breeder of hate 
yet was he a just and a benevol man honour and belov by everi one within his domain where his slightest word was glad accept law not becaus of the might he wield but becaus of his fair to all men 
i was yet a young man when a wide spread plot among the rivalpg 132 tribesmen to destroy shir jumla khan power had come to a head and had result in a determin and prolong attack upon his citadel 
number had told our out field had been devast our flock and herd driven away and crowd within the wall of the fortress were refuge from all the surround countrysid 
we had been coop up through the summer we had lost our annual crop and without the usual replenish granari and warehous were begin to wear an empti look with but sorri promis for the winter 
but calm and undismay his proud look and seren smile ever the same shir jumla khan continu to feed the hungri host within his gate and now absolut depend upon his protect 
the come of winter would mean for us some relief for the first snow would scatter the beleagu host send them back to their own valley and give us the chanc in the interv of the season storm to make a few foray on our own account on neighbour communiti which taken one at a time would be pretti well at our merci 
but if we reason in this wise so did our enemi for it was now toward the close of the month of august and redoubl effort were be put forth to accomplish the breach of our wall so that the tiger of the pathan might be slain befor there was the chanc of his fang and claw again becom danger 
the tribesmen no doubt by captur and enforc servic had securedpg 133 the help of some engin vers in the method of sieg and assault on fortifi place as practis in hindustan 
at that time i had never befor seen a sabat but now from our fortif i beheld the gradual extens day by day of a broad cover way with bullhid roof stretch across the trench be dug and effectu protect the labour below from our gun and musket and catapult 
we had made sever salli with a view to tri and stop this work but these had onli result in loss on our side out of all proport to the harass and delay inflict on the besieg 
so we could but impot watch the subtl and inexor approach of the skill men who would eventu reach our wall drive mine beneath them and blow us to perdit 
our one chanc lay in the question of time 
if the winter began earli we should be save but if the snow held off till late in the year it look as if our doom must be seal 
but quit unexpect a ray of hope came from anoth quarter 
dissens had broken out in the rank of our foe 
the first word was brought to us by a desert from the besieg camp who one night had crept up to the gateway of the fort and whine for admitt declar that he had import news to tell and hope for a reward 
i was with my grandfath when awaken from his sleep he listen to the man stori 
it told of apg 134 fierc quarrel the preced even between two of the lead chieftain 
they had been convers alon in one of their tent when sudden those without had heard angri word 
then it would seem that the owner of the tent had sent for one of the slipper which his visitor had left at the doorway and with this had administ five or six stroke over the head drive his guest forth insult and disgrac 
everi one in the camp was on the alert for fight in the morn 
with a grim smile shir jumla khan listen to this narrat 
but he made no comment he mere issu instruct for the inform to be fed and for the present close guard 
but if there had been ani linger doubt as to the truth of the stori confirm came ere the break of the dawn 
for we were onc again disturb from our rest this time by the nois of a great tumult in the camp of the besieg loud shout follow by the discharg of musket the sound gradual die away in the distanc as if a fight and a pursuit had taken place

astronomi has shatter the fallaci of astrolog and peopl have found out that the star are mind their own busi instead of meddl with their 
now while it is true that modern astronomi has supersed the ancient system and peopl have ceas to believ that the star are interven in mundan affair noth could be further from the truth than the assert that astronomi has shatter the fallaci of astrolog and those of our reader who will accord to this work an unprejud perus can hard fail to be convinc that a larg major of the peopl of christendom are domin as much by these fallaci as were our pagan ancestry—th onli differ be a chang of name 
the dogmat element of religion which was ancient design as astrolog is now known as theolog 
all the evid bear upon the subject indic that the founder of the primari form of religion were a sect of philosoph known as magi or wise men of the aryan race of central asia who have live age befor ani concept of the supernatur had obtain in the world and specul relat to the begin of thing were necessarili confin to the contempl and studi of natur the element of which they believ to be selfexist and endless in durat but be wholli without knowledg of her inher forc they explain her manifold process by conceiv the idea that she was anim by a great and inher soul or spirit eman from which impress all her part with life and motion 
thus endow man and other anim with soul eman alik from the imaginari great soul of natur they believ and taught that immedi after death all soul were absorb into their sourc where as the dewdrop slip into the shine sea all person ident was forev lost 
henc we see that although recogn the soul as immort consid it not as an entiti exist independ of matter but as the spirit of matter itself the primari religion was the expon of the purest form of materi 
be the astronom of their day and mistak the appar for the real the ancient magi construct that erron system of natur known as the geocentr and in conform thereto compos a collect of astronom allegori in which the eman from the imaginari great soul of natur by which they believ all materi were impress with life and motion were personifi and made to play their respect part 
base the religion they institut upon their system of allegor astronomi and make it personif the object of worship they thus origin the anthropomorph or manlik god and claim to have compos them under the inspir of these self same divin they design them as sacr record or scriptur and taught the ignor mass that they were liter histori and their personif real personag who have onc live upon earth and for the good of mankind perform the wondrous work imput to them were then in heaven whenc they came 
thus we see that the primari religion which is popular known as pagan was found in the worship of personifi natur that accord special homag to the imaginari genii of the star and inculc suprem ador to the divin suppos to resid in the sun it was ancient known by the general name of astrolatri and by the more specif one of solar worship and that it founder arrog to themselv the titl of astrolog gave to it dogmat element the name of astrolog 
in studi the primit form of religion it will be found that none of them taught anyth relat to a futur life for the simpl reason that their founder had no concept of such a state 
henc it follow that the law they enact were intend sole for the regul of their social relat and to secur their observ they were embodi into their sacr record and made part of their religion 
one form of that most ancient worship was known as sabaism or sabism 
anoth form of the same religion was the ancient judaism as portray in the old testament and more especi in the pentateuch or first five book in the decalogu of which the onli promis made for the observ of one of the command is length of day on earth and in a general sum up of the bless and curs to be enjoy or suffer for the observ or violat of the law as record in the 28th chapter of deuteronomi it will be seen they are all of a tempor charact onli 
at the begin of the christian era there were still in exist a sect of jew known as sadduce who were strict adher to the primit form of worship and their belief relat to the state of the dead we find record in ecclesiast xii 7 which read then shall the dust return to earth as it was and the spirit shall return to god who gave it 
for age the doctrin of soul absorpt immedi after death constitut the belief of mankind but ultim recogn the fact that the tempor punish of the exist law were wholli inadequ to the prevent of crime and conceiv the idea that the ignor and vicious mass could be govern with a surer hand by appeal to the sentiment of hope and fear in relat to the reward and punish of an imaginari futur life the ancient astrolog resolv to remodel the dogmat element of religion so as to includ that doctrin 
but realiz the necess of suppress the belief in the absorpt of all soul immedi after death they ceas to teach it and ultim it was embodi in that secret and unwritten system known as the esoter philosophi in which the astrolog formul their own privat belief and which for mani centuri was kept from the knowledg of the uniniti by their successor in the priest offic 
as they were the sole custodian of the scriptur they made do chang in their verbiag but ad the doctrin of futur reward and punish to that written and open taught system of faith known as the exoter creed they made it the more impress by institut a system of impos rite and ceremoni which they design as mysteri into which they initi the neophyt and in which were portray in the most vivid manner the reward and punish of the imaginari futur life which they taught were the award of the god for the observ or violat of the law 
these teach were inculc in the lesser degre onli but those who were found worthi of so great a distinct were also induct into the higher degre in which was impart the knowledg of the esoter philosophi 
in both the lesser and higher degre the initi receiv instruct in an oral manner onli and all were bound by the most fear oath not to reveal the secret impart to them 
thus were the votari of the ancient astral worship divid into two distinct class the esoter or gnostic and the exoter or agnost the former compris those who knew that the god were mythic and the scriptur allegor and the latter those who were taught that the god were real and the scriptur histor or in other word it was philosophi for the cultur few and religion for the ignor multitud 
the initi into the secret of these two system recogn them as the two gospel and paul must have had refer to them in his epistl to the galatian ii 2 where he distinguish the gospel which he preach on ordinari occas from that gospel which he preach privat to them which were of reput 
such was the system of astrolatri which origin in the orient and becom after be remodel in egypt the prototyp of all occident form of worship was recogn success as the state religion of the grecian and roman empir and we propos to describ the erron system of natur upon which it was base and to develop the origin of it cycl dogma ordin anniversari personif and symbol with the view to prove that it was the veri same system which was ultim perpetu under the name of christian 
we also propos to present the origin and abridg histori of it two form the jewish or ancient and the roman or modern and to give an account of the conflict between the votari of the latter and the adher to the establish form of worship which culmin in the fourth centuri in the substitut of christian as the state religion of the roman empir 
we furthermor propos to show the chang to which the creed and scriptur were subject dure the middl age and at the reform in the sixteenth centuri through which they assum the phase as now taught in the theolog respect of catholic and orthodox protestant 
we also present an articl relat to freemasonri and druidism for the purpos of show that primarili they were but differ form of the ancient astrolatri 
we also devot a few page to the subject of the sabbath and to that of pious fraud 
note—for the matter publish in this work we are princip indebt to the write of robert taylor an erudit but recus minist of the church of england who flourish about seventi year ago and who be too honest to continu to preach what after thorough investig he did not believ began to give express to his doubt by write and lectur 
not be abl to cope with his argument the clergi under the charg of the imposs crime of blasphemi had him imprison for more than two year dure which time he wrote his great work entitl the diegesi which should be read by all person who are investig the claim of the christian religion to divin authent 
roman or modern christian 
have present the evid that the jewish or ancient christian origin at the univers of alexandria under greek rule we now propos to show that it modern form eman from the same sourc under roman rule but befor enter upon this investig it is import to becom convers with the sentiment manifest toward religion by the cultur element of roman societi in that enlighten era which design as the golden age of literatur was adorn by such distinguish orat philosoph historian poet and naturalist as cicero tacitus plini horac and virgil 
the geocentr system of natur 
in construct their system of natur the ancient astronom constitut it of the earth the firmament the planet the constel and the zodiac and we will refer to them in the order name 
the earth 
believ that the earth was the onli world that it was a vast circular plane and that it was the fix and immov center around which revolv the celesti luminari the ancient astronom in conform to the requir of the doctrin of futur reward and punish as inculc in the egyptian version of the exoter creed divid it into an upper and an under or nether world which they connect by a sinuous and tenebri passag 
the firmament 
the azur dome call the firmament in the book of genesi was believ to be a solid transpar which we find describ in the fourth chapter and sixth vers of that collect of astronom allegori call the apocalyps or book of revel as a sea of glass like unto crystal 
it was repres as be support by four pillar rest upon the earth one at each of the cardin point which were design as the pillar of heaven 
conceiv the idea that there were window in the firmament the ancient astronom call them the window of heaven and taught that they were open when it rain and close when it ceas to rain 
henc it is evid that the ancient astronom did not refer to these pillar and window in a figur sens but as real appurten to a solid firmament as will be seen by refer to gen vii 
11 and viii 
2 job xxvi 
11 and malachi iii 
10 
the planet 
believ that the star were but mere flambeaux suspend beneath the firmament and revolv round the earth for the sole purpos of give it light and heat and observ that seven of these answer to the sun moon mercuri venus mar jupit and saturn had percept movement in relat to the other luminari the ancient astronom design them as planet or wander star 
the constel 
perceiv that the other celesti luminari maintain the same relat to each other and design them as fix star the ancient astronom group those visibl to them into fortyeight constel and give name to these they also attach name to the star of larger magnitud which was done for the purpos of locat and distinguish them with greater eas 
the zodiac 
through twelv of these constel most contain within a belt of 16 degre in width and within which the planet appear to revolv the ancient astronom inscrib a central line repres the eclipt or appar orbit of the sun which they divid into 360 degre and quarter these to denot the season they name the cardin point the summer and winter solstic and the vernal and autumn equinox the former refer to the longest and shortest day of the year and the latter to the two period when the day and night are equal 
an abbreviatori sign have been attach to each of these constel the great celesti belt contain them was call the wheel of the sign or a wheel in the middl of a wheel as design by that old astrolog ezekiel the prophet in chap 
i and 16th vers 
but for the reason that with onli one except the form of live thing either real or mythic were given to them this belt ultim wad design as the zodiac or circl of live creatur see ezekiel chap 
i 
constitut the essenti featur of the ancient astronomi we present in our frontispiec a diagram of the zodiac as ancient repres to which as well as to burritt celesti atlas our reader will be necessit to make frequent refer 
recent research among the ruin of ancient citi have develop the fact that sever centuri befor the begin of our era the astronom had invent the telescop and discov the true or heliocentr system of natur but for the reason that religion had been base upon the fals or geocentr system it was deem prudent not to teach it to the mass 
henc hide it away among the other secret of the esoter philosophi the knowledg of it was lost dure the middl age and when rediscov the hierarchi of the church of rome upon the plea that it was contrari to the teach of scriptur resort to inquisitori tortur to suppress it promulg but in spite of all their effort it has been univers accept and in this otherwis enlighten age we have present to us the anomali of a religion base upon a fals system of astronomi while it votari believ in the true system 
sign op the cross 
among the numer symbol of solar worship besid those we have alreadi refer to there are three to which we will direct attent 
two of these were of astronom signif the one adopt when the spring equinox was in the sign of taurus and shape like the letter t was the model after which the ancient templ were built and the other shape like the letter x in refer to the angl of 23� degre made by the cross of the eclipt and the celesti equat is known as st andrew cross 
the third and most import of all the symbol of solar worship in it relat to the christian religion which have no astronom signif origin in egypt in refer to the annual inund of the river nile 
to mark the height to which the water should rise to secur an abund harvest post were plant upon it bank to which cross beam were attach thus ┼ 
if the water should rise to the design height it was call the water of life or river of life and ultim this form of the cross was adopt as the symbol of the life to come or etern life and the ancient astrolog had it engrav upon stone encircl with a hieroglyph inscript to that effect one of which was discov in the ruin of the templ erect at alexandria and dedic to our lord and saviour serapi 
but if the water fail to rise to the requir height and the horror of starvat becom the inevit result it was the custom of the peopl to nail to these cross symbol personif of the demon of famin 
to indic the steril of the domain over which he reign he was repres by the figur of a lean and haggard man with a crown of thorn upon his head a reed cut from the river bank was place in his hand as his unreal sceptr and consid the inhabit of judea as the most slavish and meanspirit race in their knowledg they placard this figur with the inscript this is the king of the jew 
thus to the ancient egyptian this sign of the cross was bless or accurs as it was repres with or without this figur suspend upon it 
when the roman or modern form of christian was institut the hieroglyph inscript signifi the life to come or etern life was substitut by a placard nail to the cross with the letter i n r i inscrib upon it which are the initi of the latin word convey the same mean 
but if we would learn how the figur of a man came to be suspend upon this form of the cross we must refer to mediaev histori which teach that in the year 680 under the pontif of agathon and dure the reign of constantin pogonat at the sixth council of the church and third at constantinopl it was order in canon 82 that instead of a lamb the figur of a man nail to a cross should be the distinguish symbol of the christian religion 
now as this figur is repres by that of a lean and haggard man with a crown of thorn upon his head doe it not look as if the old egyptian demon of famin was the model after which it was construct 
futur reward and punish 
in the ancient astrolatri two differ system of futur reward and punish were inculc the orient or east indian and the occident or egyptian the former ignor the resurrect of the bodi taught but one judgment immedi after death and the latter inculc an individu judgment immedi after death the resurrect of the bodi and a general judgment at the end of the world or conclus of the 12000 year cycl 
the orient system 
consid perfect happi to consist in absolut rest the orient astrolog conceiv a state of etern and unconsci repos equival to soul absorpt to which they gave the name of nirvana into which they taught that by the award of the god the soul of the righteous or those who had live what they call the contempl life would be permit to enter immedi after death 
but for the soul of sinner they invent a system of expiatori punish which known as the metempsychosi or transmigr of soul taught that they would be compel to success anim the bodi of beast bird fish etc for a thousand year befor be permit to enter the nirvana 
the occident system 
in concoct the doctrin of the first judgment the egyptian astrolog ignor the nirvana inculc the futur sentient exist of the soul and while retain the metempsychoti expiat of the orient system taught that it reward and princip punish would be enjoy or suffer in the under or nether world the exist of which they had conceiv in construct their system of natur 
this imaginari region known to the egyptian as the amenti to the greek as hade and to the hebrew as sheol was divid by an impass gulf into the two state of happi and miseri which were design in the grecian mytholog as the elysium or elysian field and the tartarus 
in the lower part of the latter was locat the phlegethon or lake of fire and brimston the smoke from which ascend into an upper apart 
in this system it was taught that the soul of the two extrem of societi constitut of the righteous and the great sinner would be consign immedi after the first judgment the one to the elysium and the other to the phlegethon where they were to remain until the second or general judgment while the soul of less venial sinner constitut the greater mass of mankind befor be permit to enter the elysium would be compel to suffer the expiatori punish of the metempsychosi or in the upper region or smoki row of the tartarus 
such was the egyptian purgatori and it denizen constitut the spirit in prison refer to in i peter iii 
19 from which the astrolog claim to have the power to releas provid their surviv friend paid liber for their propitiatori offic and from this assumpt the clergi of the cathol church deriv the idea of say mass for the repos of the soul 
these doctrin were carri by pythagora from egypt to greec about 550 year befor the begin of our era and pass from thenc to rome the greek and latin poet vie with each other in portray hade and the joy and terror of it two state 
the second or general judgment 
the egyptian astrolog recogn the soul as a materi entiti and conceiv the idea that in the futur life it would requir a materi organ for it perfect action taught that at the general judgment it would be reunit to it resurrect bodi 
in conform to this belief job is made to say in chapter xix 
25 26 i know that my redeem liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though worm destroy this bodi yet in my flesh shall i see god 
the higher class egyptian howev fear that their exist would continu to be of the same shadowi and intang charact after the second judgment as they believ it would be in the amenti if worm were allow to destroy their bodi hope to preserv them until that time by the process of embalm 
the imaginari event to occur in connect with the second judgment which constitut the final of the plan of redempt and inculc in what are known as the doctrin of second advent were to be inaugur by an archangel sound a trumpet summon the quick and the dead to appear befor the bar of the god to receiv their final award 
at the second judgment design in the allegori as the last day day of judgment great and terribl day of the lord etc it was taught that the tenth and last saviour would make his second advent by descend upon the cloud and after the final award the elect be caught up to meet the lord in the air i thes 
iv 
17 the heaven and the earth would be reduc to chao through the agenc of fire 
in refer to that grand catastroph we find it record in ii 
peter iii 
10 that the heaven shall pass away with a great nois and the element shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the work that are therein shall be burn up 
after the organ of a new heaven and a new earth it was taught that upon the latter would descend a beauti citi with pear gate and golden street call the citi of god the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven or new jerusalem in which the host of the redeem would with their lord and saviour enjoy the millennium or thousand year of happi unalloy with evil and such was the kingdom for the speedi come of which the votari of astral worship were taught to pray in what is known as the lord prayer 
accord to the teach of the allegori there were to be no sun moon or star dure the millennium their author have arrang it so that the light of those luminari would not be need as we find record in rev 
xxi 
23 and xxii 
5 the citi had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glori of god did lighten it and there shall be no night there and they need no candl neither the light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light 
it must be rememb when read the fanci idea relat to the citi of god that they were compos by men who live in a veri ignor age gave free rein to fervid imagin 
jewish or ancient christian 
it is our purpos to present the evid show that a system of astral worship which we design as jewish christian was in exist more than two centuri and a half befor the institut of it modern form 
in verif of this assert we must find the initi point of our inquiri in ancient histori which teach that in the divis of the grecian empir among his general after the death of alexand the great who die 332 year befor the begin of our era the governorship of egypt and adjac provinc was secur by ptolemi lagus or soter who have subsequ suppress a revolt in judea remov from that countri a larg bodi of it inhabit to peopl the new citi of alexandria which had been laid out by order of and name after the great conqueror 
the egyptian version of the gospel stori be more appropri to the nile valley than to the region from whenc they came the greek colonist of alexandria adopt it but prefer to pay homag to serapi one of the ninth incarn of god sol which they import from pontus a greek provinc of asia minor they erect to his worship that celebr templ known as the grand serapium and transfer the cultur and refin of greec to the new citi it becam under the ptolemian dynasti a great seat of learn the art and scienc flourish an immens librari was collect the various form of astral worship were repres and school for the dissemin of the sever phase of grecian philosophi and orient gnostic were found 
such be the environ of the jewish resid of alexandria they soon acquir the vernacular and adopt the religion of the greek who have ever attach to their incarn saviour the titl signifi the christ or the anoint were known as christian 
encourag by the liber polici of philadelphus the second ptolemi a bodi of their learn men who had been educ in the greek school found a colleg for the educ of their own peopl which institut was ultim known as the univers of alexandria 
under the auspic of philadelphus the professor of that institut render their hebrew sacr record into the greek languag which translat is known as the septuagint or alexandrian version of the old testament 
have acquir from the egyptian astrolog the art of heal thaumaturgi and necrom and teach them in their school the professor of the jewish colleg of alexandria assum the titl of essen or therapeuta the egyptian and greek word signifi doctor healer or wonder worker 
possess of the sad and gloomi characterist of their race they adopt the contempl life or ascetic of the orient gnostic from which they deriv the name of ascet 
found a church for the propag of their peculiar tenet those who were set apart for the ministri assum the titl of ecclesiast 
inculc rigid temper and selfdeni among their peopl they were known as enchratit nazarit or abstain and the more devout among them retir to monasteri or to the solitud of cave and other seclud place were also design as monk cenobit friar eremit hermit or solitari 
the time have arriv accord to the cyclic teach of astral worship for the manifest of the tenth and last incarn of god sol or in other word to give a new name to the mythic genius of the sun the professor of the jewish school of alexandria is resolv to inaugur their own form of worship 
while retain the same titl under which they had paid homag to serapi and known as christian essen or therapeuta they substitut for their christ the name of the grecian bacchus which compos of the letter ��� signifi yes ie or jes 
in compos their version of the gospel stori have like their race no invent genius they appropri that of serapi as it basi and laid it scene in the land of their ancestri but inconsist retain the sign of the cross and the phraseolog connect there with which have special refer to the nile river and it annual inund had no applic whatev to the steril land of judea 
select what they conceiv to be the best from other version of the gospel stori and assum the titl of eclect they design their system as the eclect philosophi 
in proof of the eclect charact of the gospel and epistl of ancient christian we refer to the ascetic inculc therein which deriv from the orient gnostic we find perpetu in the scriptur of modern christian we also refer to the miracl of convert water into wine taken from the gospel stori of bacchus and to the statement that the saviour was the son of a carpent and was hung between two thiev copi from the stori of christna the eighth avatar of the east indian astrolatri 
thus we see that although the scene of the gospel stori of ancient christian was laid in the land of judea it author have adopt a greek version of that stori as it basi given a greek titl and name to their messiah perpetu a greek name for their sect and quot exclus from the septuagint or greek version of the old testament the fact show conclus that it was not jew of judea but hellen jew of alexandria who were the real author of the ancient christian 
the propheci 
the clergi have ever claim that the propheci are divin revel of event yet to occur and have incess agit societi by preach their speedi fulfil we propos to expos the fallaci of their teach by show that these scriptur are not the record of futur event divin reaveal but that they origin with the founder of astral worship who predic them upon predetermin event of their own concoct relat to the general judgment and set up of the kingdom of heaven which were to occur as the final of the plan of redempt and from which were deriv the doctrin of second advent and in determin the exact time when then were to occur we have but to prove that it was coincid with the conclus of the last half of the grand cycl of 12000 year which as we have shown was dedic to man as the durat of his race on earth 
as evid that the founder of the jewish or ancient christian believ like the votari of other form of astral worship that the propheci were soon to be fulfil we find that the new testament of the origin version of which they were the author is replet with such text as repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt 
iv 
17 there be some stand here which shall not tast death till they see the son of man come in his kingdom matt 
xxi 
28 the time is fulfil and the kingdom of god is at hand mark i 
15 
that the origin version of the new testament was compos when the vernal equinox was in the sign of ari we are assur by reason of the fact that it inculc homag to the lord under the symbol of the lamb and that it was dure the last or 30th degre of that sign can readili be proven by appeal to histori and to astronomi the former of which teach that the jew were remov from judea to alexandria twentyf year befor the access to the throne of philadelphus the second ptolemi to whom we have refer in our preced articl and who after reign thirtynin year die 246 year befor the begin of our era 
by refer to the celesti atlas we will find that the vernal equinox will pass out of the sign of pisc into that of aquarius or in the year 1900 and we have but to deduct that period of time from 2150 the number of year requir for the cardin point to pass through one whole sign to determin that the spring equinox pass out of the sign of ari into that of pisc 250 year befor the begin of our era or about 2100 year ago 
now from the project of the astrolog scienc we are assur that the last half of the grand cycl of 12000 year which was allot to man as the durat of his race on earth was made to begin at a time correspond to the autumn equinox when that cardin point was pass out of the sign of virgo and that of necess it had to come to an end at a time correspond to the vernal equinox when that cardin point was pass out of the sign of ari from which we know whi at the last judgment the offic of trumpet was assign to the archangel gabriel the genius of spring and whi it was a ram horn with which he was to toot the crack o doom 
when the time arriv for the fulfil of the propheci we can well imagin that fear the wrath of the lamb there were weep wail and gnash of teeth among the terrorstricken sinner while those who believ they had made their call and elect sure were look with feverish expect for the second advent of their lord and saviour and doubtless cloth with their ascens robe they watch and wait with ear alert to hear the sound of gabriel trumpet summon the quick and the dead to the general judgment 
but not a blast from the archangel ram horn was heard reverber along the sky no lord appear descend upon the cloud to meet the elect in the air and in the last act of the fear drama of judgment day the curtain refus to be rung down upon a burn world 
with the nonfulfil of the propheci the more enlighten element of societi began to scoff at the priest who were temporarili demor but true to their decept instinct soon ralli with the plea of a mistak have been made in the calcul base upon the propheci they undoubt concoct scriptur to meet that veri emerg for to the taunt of the scoffer who in refer to the second advent of the lord enquir where is the sign of his come 
for sinc the father fell asleep all thing continu as they were from the begin of creation they answer that the lord is not slack concern his promis but as a thief in the night he would soon come and all thing be fulfil

follow up the histori of this interest subject we find that the founder of modern christian to which we will refer in our next articl in compos their version of the new testament from that of the jewish or ancient christian made no chang in it verbiag relat to the propheci but when constantin i emperor of rome becam the patron of the church her hierarchi tire of figur upon them secur a long respit from that troublesom subject by claim to have made other calcul which put off the time of fulfil to the year 1000 and from histori we learn when the time arriv the whole of christendom was fear agit upon the subject sinc then everi generat has been vex with the fallaci of second advent and the fact of the case justifi the charg that the clergi by teach that the propheci refer to event yet to occur are perpetu a most stupend fraud upon christendom and an earnest and effici protest should be inaugur against the further agit of the monstrous delus of second advent which is frighten thousand of weakmind peopl into insan and caus a vast amount of social distressgod sol 
in determin the characterist of the suprem divin of astral worship it must be born in mind that it founder taught that he was evolv or engend by the father or first person in the sacr triad from his pure substanc which as we have shown was constitut of chao or the primev fire into which they suppos all thing were reduc through the agenc of that element at the conclus of 12000 year cycl 
henc design that mythic be as the onli begotten of the father they personifi him as god the son or second person in the sacr triad and recogn the sun as the rule star veri appropri made him the presid genius of that luminari under the titl of god sol 
accord homag to light as his chief attribut he is refer to in the allegori as the true light which lighteth everi man that cometh into the world john i 9 and although design as the onli begotten of the father his coexist with him under the titl of the logo or word is shown in the text which read in the begin was the word and the word was with god and the word was god john i 1 
personifi the principl of good and evil in god sol the ancient astrolog consecr the six divis of the 12000 year cycl correspond to the reproduct month of spring and summer to him as lord of good and symbol him by the constel of the zodiac in which the vernal equinox success occur as explain hereaft they dedic the six divis of that cycl correspond to the destruct month of autumn and winter to him as lord of evil and as such symbol him by the serpent mark the begin of his reign by the constel serpen place in conjunct with the autumn equinox 
personifi in him the oppos principl of good and evil he was to the ancient both god and devil or the vari god who in relat to the season was describ as beauti in spring power in summer benefic in autumn and terribl in winter 
thus under various name intend to repres god sol in relat to the diversifi season we find record in the scriptur or solar fabl numer portray of imaginari conflict in which the evil principl triumph dure autumn and winter is conquer at the vernal equinox by the good principl who bring back equal day and night restor the harmoni of natur 
the etern enmiti between the principl of good and evil as manifest in the divers of the season we find portray in the constel hercul and draco place in the northern heaven in which the heel of the former repres one of the most ancient of the imaginari incarn of god sol to which we will refer hereaft is rest upon the head of the latter as refer to in genesi iii 15 which make god sol or the lord god say to the serpent i will put enmiti between thee and the woman and between thi seed and her seed it shall bruis thi head and thou shalt bruis his heel 
the woman allud to in this text is the virgo of the zodiac as will be made appar hereaft 
of all the divin of the ancient mytholog god sol was the onli one distinguish by the exalt titl of lord or lord god for the reason that he was made the organ of chao and governor of heaven and earth 
henc have constitut him the lord of light and dark as well as good and evil the ancient astrolog in compos the solar fabl made him say of himself i form the light and creat dark i make peac and creat evil i the lord do all these thing isaiah xlv 7 
shall there be evil in a citi and the lord hath not done it 
amo iii 6 
besid the titl of lord or lord god the solar divin is also design in the allegori as the lord of lord and the king of king the invinc the mighti god etc 
subject the mythic genius of the sun in his appar annual revolut round the earth to the four stage of human life from infanc to old age the ancient magi fix the natal day of the young god sol at the winter solstic the virgo of the zodiac was made his mother and the constel in conjunct with her which is now known as boot but ancient call arcturus his foster father 
he is repres as hold in leash two hunt dog and drive ursa major or the great bear around the north pole thus show that the origin occup of the celesti foster father of the young god sol was that of a bear driver and that his son refer to in job xxxviii 32 are the dog asterion and chara 
it will be observ that virgo is repres in our illustr with a child in her arm for the reason that she is so repres in the ancient zodiac and the fact will be readili conced that she is the onli virgin who could give birth to a child and be a virgin still 
the ancient cosmogoni 
specul relat to the order in which chao had been organ the ancient astrolog construct a cosmogoni which divid the labor of god the son or second person in the triniti into six period of a thousand year each and which answer to the six divis of the 12000 year cycl correspond to the reproduct month of spring and summer taught that in the first period he made the earth in the second the firmament in the third veget in the fourth the sun and moon and the star also in the fifth the anim fish bird etc and in the sixth man 
that veget was made befor the sun was not an inconsist idea to the origin of the ancient cosmogoni 
they imagin that the heat and light eman from the elementari fire were suffici to stimul it growth after which god the son gather it togeth and made the celesti luminari 
in the solar fabl this imaginari element is call the fireeth or sacr fire of the star 
fall and redempt of man 
religion have been base upon the worship of personifi natur it is evid that it founder fabric it dogmat element from their concept of her destruct and reproduct process as manifest in the rotat and divers of the season 
the appar retreat of the sun from the earth in winter and his return in the spring suggest the idea of a figur death and resurrect of the genius of that luminari they appli these phenomena of the year to man and compos the allegori relat to his fall and redempt as inculc in the exoter creed 
in the allegori relat to the fall it was taught that after make the first human pair the lord of good or the lord god place them in a beauti garden—correspond to the season of fruit and flower or month of spring and summer with the injunct under a penalti not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree 
when the lord of evil or devil symbol by the serpent and repres by the constel serpen place in conjunct with the autumn equinox meet them on the confin of his dominion and tempt the woman and she the man they ate of the forbidden fruit thus fall from their first estat and commit the origin sin they involv the whole human race in the consequ of their disobedi 
then the lord god pronounc a curs against the serpent cloth the man and woman with skin to protect them against the inclem of his dominion as lord of evil and drove them from the garden after which they were necessit to earn their bread by till the ground 
in refer to the plan of redempt the ancient astrolog divid the 6000 year appropri to man as the durat of his race on earth into ten equal cycl and taught that at the conclus of each god sol as lord of good would manifest himself in the flesh to destroy his work as lord of evil and through suffer and death make an aton for sin 
thus have origin the doctrin of origin sin incarn and vicari aton as part of the plan of redempt and make it final correspond in point of time to the conclus of the 12000 year cycl their successor in the priest offic ultim inculc the addit dogma of the general judgment and futur reward and punish as we have shown in our introduct 
have base the fabl of the fall and redempt of man upon the idea that he was impel without his volit to pass from the dominion of god to that of the devil or in other word upon his subject to the inexor necess which make the inclement season of autumn and winter succeed the benefic one of spring and summer it author compos the origin of the text which found in roman viii 20 read that the creatur was made subject to vaniti evil not will but by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope 
but for the popular teach in favor of it be liter histori no one could read the account of the fall of man as record in the third chapter of genesi without recogn it as simpli an allegori or fail to realiz the forc of the argument of no fall no redempt and if no redempt no god to reward or devil to punish no hell to suffer or heaven to enjoy 
the fact is that these are but antithet idea which came in togeth and must surviv or perish togeth 
they cannot be separ without destroy the whole theolog fabric 
incarn of god sol 
believ that god sol was necessit to remain at his post to direct the cours of the sun the ancient astrolog conceiv the idea of teach that attend by a retinu of subordin genii he descend to earth through the medium of incarn at the end of 600 year cycl to perform the work of man redempt and have made virgo of the zodiac the mother of the solar divin they taught in their allegor astronomi or scriptur that his incarn were born of a virgin 
henc we find that god sol usual design by the titl of the word was made flesh and dwelt among us 
john i 14 
in a discours upon this text deliv by tillotson archbishop of canterburi in the year 1680 publish in the fourth volum of woodhous edit of his grace sermon in the year 1744 concern the incarn of our bless saviour he explain the necess of incarn by say that there was likewis a great inclin in mankind to the worship of a visibl deiti so god was pleas to appear in our natur that they who were so fond of a visibl deiti might have one even a true and natur imag of god the father the express imag of his person 
it onli requir a littl reflect to appreci the prelat covert ironi and want of faith 
have ascrib to the imaginari incarn of god sol the characterist of heavendescend virginborn earthwalk wonderwork die resuscit and ascend son of god the ancient astrolog attach to them the sever titl of saviour redeem avatar divinehelp shiloh messiah christ and in refer to their fosterfath that of son of man 
teach that they continu to make intercess for sin after their ascens to the right hand of the father they were also call intercessor mediat or advoc with the father 
from teach their appear everi 600 year origin the egyptian legend of the phoenix a bird said to descend from the sun at these interv and after be consum upon the altar in the templ of on or citi of the sun—cal heliopoli by the greeks—would rise from it ash and ascend to it sourc 
accord to the civil law of egypt manhood was not attain until the age of thirti year 
henc the earth mission of incarn saviour was made to begin at that age and for the reason that relat to the appar transit of the sun through the twelv sign of the zodiac it was complet dure the period of one year 
to impress the ignor mass with the belief that the scriptur were liter histori and the incarn saviour real personag the ancient astrolog caus tomb to be erect in which it was claim they were buri 
such sepulchr were erect to hercul at cadiz to apollo at delphi and to other saviour at mani other place to which their respect votari were induc to perform pilgrimag 
in egypt the pyramid were built part for astronom purpos and part as tomb for saviour claim to have been king who had onc rule over the countri and whi should we not recogn that magnific structur known as the church of the holi sepulchr at jerusalem as but anoth of those tomb of saviour in which no saviour was ever entomb 
thus we have shown that it was god sol the onli begotten of the father or second person in the sacr triad to whom suprem ador was inculc in all form of the ancient astrolatri and that it cultur votari understand that the doctrin pertain to the fall and redempt of man were evolv from the figur death and resurrect of the solar divin recogn the doctrin of incarn as a priest invent intend onli for the ignor mass 
fabl of the twelv labor 
the author of the origin solar fabl have live in that remot age in which physic prowess was recogn as the highest attribut of human conceiv the idea that god sol while pass through his appar orbit had to fight his way with the anim of the zodiac and with other in conjunct with them 
henc design him as the mighti hunter and call his exploit the twelv labor they made the incarn saviour the hero of similar one on earth which they taught were perform for the good of mankind and that after fulfil their earth mission they were exhal to heaven through the agenc of fire 
when these fabl were compos the summer solstic was in the sign of leo and make the twelv labor begin in it the first consist in the kill of a lion and the second in rescu a virgin virgo by the destruct of a hydra the constel in conjunct with her 
upon one of the assyrian marbl on exhibit in the british museum these two labor are repres as have been perform by a saviour by the name of nimroud 
in the constel of taurus the bull of the zodiac and of orion origin known as horn in conjunct therewith we have group of star repres the latter as one of the mighti hunter of the ancient astrolatri support on his left arm the shield of the lion skin the trophi of the first labor and hold a club in his uplift right hand is engag in perform the tenth labor by a conflict with the former 
the fabl of the twelv labor constitut the sacr record or scriptur of the older form of astrolatri one version of which written with the cuneiform charact upon twelv tablet of burnt clay exhum from the ruin of an assyrian citi and now on exhibit in the british museum is ascrib to nimroud the prototyp of the grecian hercul and of nimrod the mighti hunter of the old testament 
anniversari of solar worship 
the nativ 
appli the anniversari inculc in the worship of god sol to his imaginari incarn the founder of the ancient astrolatri made them refer to the sever stage of human exist from infanc to matur age 
henc compar the first day of infantil life to the shortest day of the year it would natur be expect that they would have place the anniversari of the nativ exact at the winter solstic but have conceiv the idea that the sun stood still for the space of three day at each of the cardin point and make it repres the figur death of the genius of that luminari they fix the date for it observ three day later or on the 25th of decemb 
the gnostic adher to the ancient solar worship or those who were convers with the teach of the esoter philosophi know that the dramati person� of the fabl of incarn were pictur with star upon the azur vault recogn the woman cloth with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelv star refer to in revel xii 
1 as the virgo of the zodiac they also knew that she was the true queen of heaven and mother of god and that the infant ancient repres in her arm and with whom in their day she aros on the eastern horizon at midnight on the 24th of decemb was the same of whom the peopl were taught to sing at christma unto us a child is born this day 
with the knowledg of these fact we can readili see that this is the virgin and child which constitut the origin of those exquisit paint by the old master known as the madonna and child 
epiphani or twelfth day 
in refer to the twelv sign through which the sun make his appar annual revolut the twelfth day after christma answer to the 6th of januari was observ by the votari of the ancient astrolatri as the anniversari of the epiphani or twelfth day 
in the solar fabl it was taught that a star appear in the heaven on that day to manifest the birthplac of the infant saviour to the magi or wise men of the east who came to pay him homag and to present him with the gift of gold frankincens and myrrh as relat in matthew ii 
11 
the reason for present these gift is explain by the fact that of the seven metal dedic to the genii of the planet gold was the one consecr to god sol and frankincens and myrrh were the gum burn in censer in his worship 
in read the account of the magi visit to the infant saviour we have but to exercis our think faculti to realiz that it is allegori instead of liter histori 
lent or lenten season 
in the ancient solar fabl it was taught that the persecut to which the incarn saviour were subject while pass through the dominion of god sol as lord of evil rage with greatest furi dure the forti day preced the festiv of easter which period begin when the day were percept lengthen was call lent or the lenten season 
it was dure this season that the votari of the ancient religion were taught to manifest their sympathi for the saviour in his imaginari conflict with the devil by abstain from all festiv and by fast and prayer and as that was the season in which the flock and herd were poor in flesh while the sea and river abound with fish in good condit the ancient priest make a virtu of necess enjoin a diet princip of fish and for that reason place the constel pisc at the point in the zodiac in which the lenten season ancient began which without regard to the day of the week was alway observ on the 15th day of februari the name of that month have been deriv from the februa or feast of purif and expiat of the old roman calendar 
at the council of nice the lenten season was made to begin on the fourth day of the week and in refer to the ancient custom of the more devout sprinkl ash upon their head at the feast of the februa it is call ash wednesday 
henc we see that all year in which ash wednesday doe not come on the 15th of februari the lenten season must necessarili contain a greater or lesser number than the origin assign of forti day 
passion week 
the last seven day of lent is call passion week in refer to the appar passag of the sun across the celesti equat at the vernal equinox or 21st of march the ancient astrolog have conceiv the idea that the sun stood still for the space of three day at each of the cardin point and make it repres the figur death of the genius of that luminari it was observ as the anniversari of the vernal crucifixion or passion of the incarn saviour and in commemor of their imaginari suffer and death it was the custom to expos in the templ dure the last three day of passion week figur repres their dead bodi over which the votari of solar worship especi the women made great lament 
it was in refer to one of these imag laid out in the templ at jerusalem to which the jealous jehovah consid it a great abomin in his own hous is made to direct the attent of ezekiel the prophet who look beheld women weep for tammuz as record in the eighth chapter 
this divin was the phoenician prototyp of the grecian adoni to whom the women of judea prefer to pay homag 
it was dure the last three day of passion week that the votari of solar worship perform their severest penanc 
besid fast and prayer the more devout flagel and slash themselv and other with knive and thong and carri heavi cross up steep accliv 
in all ultracathol countri the priest in imit of the ancient custom expos in the church figur repres the dead saviour over which the laiti especi the women weep and mourn and the more devout men cut and slash themselv and each other with knive and thong and in imit of the imaginari tramp of jesus with his cross up calvari rug side bear heavi cross up steep accliv 
passion play 
ancient drama repres the passion of incarn saviour call passion play were enact upon the stage 
the most celebr of these divin tragedi known as prometheus bound and compos by the greek poet �schylus was play at athen 500 year befor the begin of the christian era 
to show that this sinaton saviour was not chain to a rock while vultur prey upon his vital as popular taught but was nail to a tree we quot front potter translat of the play that passag which readili recogn as the origin of a christian song read as follow lo stream from the fatal tree his all aton blood is this the infinit 
tis he— prometheus and a god 
well might the sun in dark hide and veil his glori in when god the great prometheus die for man the creatur sin 
the veil of the sun as repres in these play have refer to the imaginari sympathi express by god sol for the suffer of his incarn son was shown upon the stage by shade the light 
the monk of the middl age enact play repres the passion of the christian saviour and the bavarian peasantri perpetu this custom perform the play everi tenth year 
resurrect and easter festiv 
in conform to the ancient teach the incarn saviour consid as figur dead for the space of three day at the vernal equinox or 21st of march were rais to new of life after the expir of that time 
henc the 25th of march without regard to the day of the week was celebr as the anniversari of the vernal resurrect 
on the morn of this day it was the custom of the astrolog to say to the mourner assembl in the templ be of good cheer sacr band of initi your god has risen from the dead his pain and his suffer shall be your salvat 
anoth form of this admonit quot from an ancient poem in refer to the phoenician tammuz read as follow trust ye saint your god restor trust ye in your risen lord for the pain which he endur your salvat hath procur 
then would begin the festiv of easter which corrupt from eostr and deriv from the teuton mytholog was one of the mani name given to the goddess of spring 
in the observ of this festiv the templ were adorn with floral offer the hilari sang their joy lay the fire upon the pyre or the firealtar were extinguish and rekindl with new fire or sacr fire of the star which the astrolog taught was brought down from heaven by the wing genius perseus the constel which ancient was in conjunct with the vernal equinox paschal candl lit from the new fire were distribut to the faith and the paschal feast easter feast or the feast of the passov was eaten in commemor of the passion of the incarn saviour or in other word of the passag of the sun across the celesti equat 
in ultracathol countri the descent of the sacr fire is repres by some secret arrang pyrotechni and the credul laiti believ they have wit a miracul display eager solicit paschal candl lit from it and in imit of the ancient festiv in honor of the return of spring all cathol church and most of protest one are adorn with flower the bell ring out their merriest peal and gloria in excelsi and other jubil song similar to the lay of the ancient hilari are sung 
annunci 
the anniversari of the nativ have been place on the 25th of decemb accord to the cours of natur the 25th of march was ancient celebr as the anniversari of the annunci and is still observ on that day and the duti of salut the virgin virgo and announc her concept by the holi ghost or third person in the triniti was assign to the genius of spring 
in the chaldean version of the gospel stori the name of gabriel was given to this personif and in the christian version of that stori he is made to perform the same offic see luke i 
2635 
ascens 
celebr the anniversari of the ascens forti day after easter it was ancient observ on the 4th of may and it was taught that the incarn saviour ascend bodili into heaven in a golden chariot drawn by four hors caparison with gild trap all glitter like fire in the fervid sunlight 
henc when we read in ii 
king ii 
11 that there appear a chariot of fire and hors of fire 


and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven we must accept this text as descript of the imaginari ascens of one of the incarn saviour of ancient judaism 
assumpt 
when the summer solstic was in the sign of cancer the sun was in that of virgo in the month of august and the anniversari of the assumpt was observ on the 15th of that month and is so observ at the present time 
the fact that the anniversari of the ascens preced that of the assumpt explain whi jesus is made to say to his mother virgo soon after his resurrect touch me not for i am not yet ascend to my father

the lord supper 
in the ancient solar worship the socal ordin of the lord supper was observ just befor the anniversari of the autumn crucifixion and consist of bread and wine in refer to the matur of the crop and complet of the vintag was like the modern festiv of the hardest home a season of thank to the lord god sol as the giver of all good gift 
henc be observ but onc a year it was in realiti not an ordin but an anniversari and the fact that christian partak of these emblem so frequent dure the year indic that the origin signif of the lord supper has been lost 
transubstanti or the convers of the bread and wine into the verit blood and bodi of christ is a doctrin of the cathol church which was deriv from the ritual of the ancient solar worship 
in the 26th chapter of matthew we have an account of the lord administ the last supper to his discipl on the eve of the autumn crucifixion and in vers 27 it read that he took the cup and gave thank and gave it to them say drink ye all of it 
the compil of the modern version of the gospel stori must sure have inadvert copi this text as it read in the ancient version of that old old stori which when observ in remembr of our lord and saviour bacchus was call the bacchanalia or feast of bacchus 
at these orgi the particip give thank for the wine by not onli drink all of one cup but mani more in fact they kept on drink until they fell under the tabl 
autumn crucifixion 
the benefic season of spring and summer come to an end at the autumn equinox the 22d of septemb was made the anniversari of the autumn crucifixion 
the vernal resurrect and autumn crucifixion repres the altern triumph of the personifi principl of good and evil as manifest in the divers of the season we find appropri express in two religi pictur 
in the one the saviour appeal as a vigor young man surround by a brilliant halo repres the ray of the allconqu sun of spring is rise triumphant from the tomb befor whom the demon of winter or devil is seen retreat in the background 
in the other the vanquish saviour repres by the figur of a lean and haggard man with a crown of thorn upon his head around which appear a faint halo of the sun declin ray and abov which is placard the letter i n r i the initi letter of latin word signifi the life to come or the etern life is suspend upon the cross at the foot of which his mother mari virgo is repres as kneel in a mourn attitud and by her side is seen a serpent and a skull the emblem of evil and of death 
michaelma 
in the calendar of the ancient astral worship the fourth day after the autumn equinox was dedic to the genius of autumn 
in the chaldean allegori the name of michael was given to this personif and call michaelma or feast of michael 
in the cathol calendar this anniversari is place an the 29th of septemb instead of the 26th of that month while that of st matthew the christian genius of autumn which should be place on the 26th of that month is observ on the 21st 
thus we have shown that the anniversari of the ancient astral worship were all fix and from church histori we learn that they were so observ by the christian until the council of nice in the year 325 when the bishop assembl at that celebr convoc desir to have the festiv of easter celebr on sunday which had been made the sabbath by the edict of constantin in the year 321 order that it should be observ on the sunday of the full moon which come on or next after the vernal equinox 
henc convert it into a movabl festiv it alli feast and fast day were also made movabl 
personif of the divis of time 
in the ancient solar fabl the sever divis of time were personifi and made to pay homag to the triun deiti suppos to be enthron abov the firmament 
the hour 
the genii of the hour were design as elder and we find them describ in the 4th chapter of revel as sit round about the throne upon four and twenti seat cloth in white raiment and crown of gold upon their head 
the day 
each day of the year was appropri personifi and these genii of the day constitut the saint of the christian calendar 
of these we will refer to but one 
accord to the ancient belief that the sun stood still for the space of three day at each of the cardin point the 24th of june was made the first of the decreas day and dedic it to st john the baptist he is made to say in refer to his opposit the genius of the 25th of decemb and first of the increas day he must increas but i must decreas 
this text found in john iii 
30 simpli mean that the day of the one must increas in length while the day of the other must decreas 
the month 
the fabl of the twelv labor have been supersed by other in which the genii of the twelv sign of the zodiac correspond to the month were design as angel and made to minist to god sol while make his appar annual revolut but when constitut the attend of the incarn saviour dure their imaginari earth life they were personifi as men and call discipl 
of these genii of the month we will refer onli to the first and the last 
the first month dedic to the genius known in the mytholog as janus and from which was deriv the name januari was portray with two face the one of an old man look mourn backward over the old year and the other of a young man look joy forward to the new year 
this personif made the open of the year and repres as hold a pair of crosskey was call the carrier of the key of the kingdom of heaven 
henc the pope of rome claim apostol success from peter the janus of the christian twelv wear crosskey as the insignia of their offic 
sometim a crosier or shepherd crook is substitut for one of the key in refer to his arrog offic of the leader of the sheep 
the author for the assumpt that the pope are peter successor is found in matthew xvi 
18 19 but it fallaci becom appar when we bear in mind that the scriptur are but collect of astronom allegori and that the peter refer to in the text was not a man but the mythic genius of the month of januari 
in refer to the last month we find that the author of the ancient solar fabl ever doubt whether god sol after inaugur winter by his suppos retreat from the earth would return to revivifi natur with his lifegiv ray gave to the genius of the twelfth month the titl of the doubter 
in the christian calendar this personif is known as thoma and a more specif dedic of the shortest day of the year have been made to him the 21st day of decemb is call st thoma day 
the season 
when the cardin point were in the constel leo taurus aquarius and scorpio the astrolog object to the signif of the latter substitut the constel in conjunct therewith which is known as aquila akwela or fli eagl 
in the allegor astronomi of that remot period these genii of the season were design as beast and as such we find them refer to in revel iv 
7 which read as follow and the first beast was like a lion leo and the second beast like a calf taurus the bull calf and the third beast had a face as a man aquarius the waterman and the fourth beast was like a fli eagl aquila 
in the first chapter of ezekiel the prophet the genii of the season are refer to in the same manner 
these genii of the season stand imaginarili at the four corner of the heaven were call cornerkeep and make them wit to god sol in his appar annual revolut the founder of the astral worship design them as archangel evangelist godspel or gospelbear and claim inspir from them compos four differ histori of the birth and earthlif of the incarn saviour to each of which they attach a name and call these record the gospel stori 
in it chaldean version the name of gabriel michael raphael and uriel were given them but while the first two of these are mention in the christian gospel stori it author gave to the evangelist the name of matthew mark luke and john 
thus know the true signif of the discipl and evangelist the veri pertin question present itself if they are not the genii of the month and the season whi are there just twelv of the one and four of the other 
half year of increas day 
in the ancient astrolatri the half year of increas day extend from the winter to the summer solstic was personifi by the composit figur repres the constel of taurus and aquarius which constitut of the wing bodi of a bull and the head and beard of a man was call the cherubim 
this personif we find portray upon the assyrian marbl on exhibit in the british museum 
half year of decreas day 
the half year of decreas day extend from the summer to the winter solstic was personifi by the figur which repres the constel of leo and aquila and compos of the wing bodi and limb of a lion with the head of an eagl was call the seraphim 
these last two personif constitut the archangel of the ancient astral worship 
last quarter of the year 
the last quarter of the year was personifi in the ancient allegori as a decrepit old man who stung by a scorpion scorpio and fatal wound by an arrow from the quiver of an archer saggitarius die at the winter solstic and after lie in the grave for the space of three day is brought to life again 
such was the personif refer to in the christian gospelstori as have been rais from the grave by the mandat come forth lazarus 
thus have we shown that the elder and the saint the angel and the archangel the cherubim and seraphim and also poor old lazarus are but personif of the sever divis of time

have shown that the founder of the ancient astrolatri accord homag to god sol as lord of evil under the symbol of the serpent and mark the begin of his reign as such by the constel serpen place in conjunct with the autumn equinox we will now direct attent to the symbol under which he was worship as lord of good which correspond to the form of the constel in which occur the vernal equinox and which was chang to correspond to the form of the succeed constel as that cardin point pass into it by that process known in astronomi as the precess of the equinox it explan becom essenti to a correct understand of our subject 
after long observ aid by the telescop of which they were undoubt the origin inventor the ancient astrolog discov that the sun in make his appar annual revolut did not return to the same point in the heaven but fell behind that of the preced year at the rate of 50� second of a degre annual 
at this rate of precess which modern calcul has confirm it requir 71 23 year for the cardin point to pass through one degre on the eclipt and 2150 year through thirti degre or one sign of the zodiac 
the knowledg of this process afford an exact chronolog we are enabl not onli to determin the origin of these symbol but to approxim veri near to the respect date of their adopt 
the sphinx 
from the teach of astronomi we learn that the summer solstic is now occupi the point between the sign of taurus and gemini from which we know that that cardin point has pass through three whole sign sinc it was between the sign of leo and virgo and we have but to multipli 2150 by 3 to determin that it has been about 6450 year ago 
henc the tourist to the nile valley when view near the base of old cheop the great egyptian pyramid a coloss head and bust of a woman carv in stone and learn that it is attach to a bodi in the form of a lion in a crouch attitud 146 feet long hidden beneath the shift sand of the libyan desert if possess of the knowledg of the precess of the equinox he will be enabl to solv the riddl of the sphinx by recogn in that grotesqu monument the midsumm symbol of solar worship when the summer solstic was between the sign of leo and virgo 
the dragon 
when the summer solstic was between the sign of leo and virgo the winter solstic was between those of aquarius and pisc and the figur compos of the bodi of a man with the tail of a fish becam the midwint symbol of solar worship 
such was the form of this symbol to which the ancient phoenician paid homag to the lord under the name of dagon 
the bull 
at the same time the summer solstic enter the sign of leo the vernal equinox enter that of taurus and the bull becom the spring symbol of solar worship—th lord was design in the ancient allegori as the bull of god which taketh away the sin of the world which shorn of it allegor sens signifi the sun in taurus or sun of spring which taketh away the evil of winter 
such is the purport of hieroglyph inscript upon papyrus roll found in egypt and engrav upon obelisk erect in the nile valley one of which has been recent brought to the citi of new york and set up in central park 
in the east indi this symbol was repres by the figur of a bull with the solar disk between his horn and the egyptian who were of hindoo origin perpetu it in their api it was reproduc in the golden calf of the ancient israelit 
the assyrian repres this symbol by the figur of a wing bull with the face and beard of a man the phoenician in their baal by the figur of a man with a bull head and horn and the small silver bull head with golden horn recent discov by dr schliemann in the ruin of mycena were jewel worn by the women of that ancient citi when the vernal equinox was in the sign of taurus 
the ram 
by deduct 2150 year from 6450 we determin that about 4300 year ago the vernal equinox enter the sign of ari and the spring symbol of solar worship chang from the bull to the ram was repres by ramhead figur two of which found in egypt are on exhibit in the british museum 
then the text which read the bull of god was chang to the ram of god which taketh away the sin of the world 
the lamb 
ultim attach a meek and lowli disposit to the imaginari incarn of the mythic genius of the sun the symbol of the ram was chang to that of the lamb and the text in the allegori which read the ram of god was chang to read the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world john i 29 
the explan we have given relat to the zodiac symbol of solar worship make the assur doubli sure that the origin of the new testament were compos when the vernal equinox was in the sign of ari as will be shown hereaft 
have adopt the symbol of the lamb it was repres by sever form of what is known as agnus dei or lamb of god one of which was in the form of a bleed lamb with a vase attach into which blood is flow which origin in refer to the shed of blood as a vicari aton for sin 
but the most comprehens form of this symbol in it astronom signif was repres by the figur of a lamb in a stand attitud support the circl of the zodiac divid into quarter to denot the season 
at each of the cardin point there was a small cross and the lamb held in it uplift forefoot a larger cross the long arm of which was made to cut the celesti equat at the angl of 23� degre the true angl of obliqu of the eclipt 
this symbol is still retain in the cathol church 
the fish 
by deduct 2150 year from 4300 we determin that about 2150 year ago the vernal equinox enter the sign of pisc and although the origin version of the new testament was found upon the symbol of the lamb it is a histor fact that for centuri after the begin of our era the christian paid homag to the lord under the symbol of the fish but ultim go into desuetud the lamb was retain as the distinguish symbol of the christian religion until the year 680 at which date anoth was substitut as will be shown under our next head 
the sacr number 7 and 12 
in refer to the planet and the sign of the zodiac the number seven and twelv were recogn as sacr by the ancient astrolog and dedic were made to them in all kind and sort of form 
in the allegori the genii of the planet were design as spirit or messeng to the suprem deiti imaginarili enthron abov the firmament which we find describ in revel iv 
5 as seven lamp of fire burn befor the throne which are the seven spirit of god and which were repres by light burn in seven branch candlestick set befor the altar in the templ the central light for the sun the moon mercuri and venus on one side and mar jupit and saturn on the other 
the seven branch candlestick seen in all cathol church and in some protest one are intend to repres the same planetari system 
among the numer dedic to the genii of the planet we mention the seven day of the week the seven stori of the tower of babylon the seven gate of thebe the seven pipe flute of pan the seven string lyre of apollo the seven book of fate the book of seven seal the seven cast into which the egyptian and east indian were divid and the jubile of seven time seven year 
among the dedic to the twelv sign we mention the twelv month of the year the grand cycl of 12000 year the twelv altar of jame the twelv labor of hercul the twelv divis of the egyptian labyrinth the twelv shield of mar the twelv precious stone rang in three to denot the season in the breastplat of high priest the twelv foundat of the sacr citi refer to in the book of revel the twelv son of jacob the twelv tribe of israel and the twelv discipl 
in the book of revel alon the number 7 is repeat twentyfour time and the number 12 fourteen time 
the twelv thousand year cycl 
in determin the durat of the period within which were to occur the event taught in the doctrin of the exoter creed the ancient astrolog dedic a thousand year to each of the sign of the zodiac and thus inaugur the cycl of twelv thousand year taught that at it conclus the heaven and the earth which they believ to be compos of the indestruct element of fire air earth and water would through the agenc of the first of these be reduc to chao as a preliminari to the reorgan of a new heaven and a new earth at the begin of the succeed cycl 
such was the origin of the grand cycl of the ancient astrolatri and it must be born in mind that it author made it conclus to correspond in time and circumst to the doctrin relat to the final of the plan of redempt 
the ancient triad 
after conceiv the idea of a primev chao constitut of four indestruct element of which fire was the lead one the orient astrolog began to indulg in specul relat to the agenc which were engag in it organ 
have no knowledg of the forc inher in natur they imput this work to three intellig which embodi the all in all they personifi by the figur of a man with three head and to this triniti gave the name of brahma vishnu and siva 
such a figur carv in stone may be seen in the island cave of elephanta near bombay india and is popular believ to repres the creator preserv and destroy but in determin their true signif we must be govern by the ancient teach that all thing were made by one godhead with three name and this god is all thing 
henc the conclus is irresist that the first person repres neither the creator nor organ of chao but chao itself the second person it organ and governor and the third person the agent in natur which impress all her part with life and motion the latter be the imaginari great soul or spirit inculc in the esoter philosophi 
in support of this opinion it will be found that the egyptian triad of father son and spirit is virtual the same we have assign to it orient prototyp 
thus we see that to the ancient astrolatri christendom is indebt for the triniti of god the father god the son god the spirit—thre in one 
but have ascrib suprem intellig or reason to it second person under the name of the logo or word and design it third person as the holi ghost the ancient triad was usual formul as the father the word and the holi ghost as may be seen by refer to the text in the allegori which we find record in i john v 7 which read that there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holi ghost and these three are one 
consid in some form of astrolatri as too sacr to attach a name to the triun deiti he was call the one and we find him thus design in the 4th chapter of revel where like zeus and jupit of the grecian and roman mytholog he is repres as seat abov the firmament upon a throne from which proceed lightn and thunder and to whom all the subordin divin were made to pay homag 
as the hurler of thunderbolt he was call the thunder and as the open of the window of heaven when it rain he was design jupit pluvius 
such was the ancient triad made to say of himself in an inscript found in the ruin of the templ at sai in egypt i am all that has been all that is and all that shall be and no mortal has lift yet the veil that cover me and such was the triuniti refer to as the god univers by plini the roman philosoph and naturalist who flourish in the first centuri of the christian era wrote that he is an infinit god which has never been creat and which shall never come to an end 
to look for someth els beyond it is useless labor for man and out of his reach 
behold that truli sacr be etern and immens which includ within itself everyth it is all in all or rather itself is all 
it is the work of natur and itself is natur 
thus we see that although inculc homag to a multitud of subordin divin the ancient astrolatri was onli an appar polyth it enlighten votari recogn the dogma of the uniti of god were in realiti monotheist pay suprem ador to the mythic genius of the sun to whom we will now direct attent

it was in the begin of the month of novemb 17when a young english gentleman who had just left the univers of oxford made use of the liberti afford him to visit some part of the north of england and curios extend his tour into the adjac frontier of the sister countri 
he had visit on the day that open our histori some monast ruin in the counti of dumfri and spent much of the day in make draw of them from differ point so that on mount his hors to resum his journey the brief and gloomi twilight of the season had alreadi commenc 
his way lay through a wide tract of black moss extend for mile on each side and befor him 
littl emin aros like island on it surfac bear here and there patch of corn which even at this season was green and sometim a hut or farmhous shade by a willow or two and surround by larg elderbush 
these insul dwell communic with each other by wind passag through the moss impass by ani but the nativ themselv 
the public road howev was toler well made and safe so that the prospect of be benight brought with it no real danger 
still it is uncomfort to travel alon and in the dark through an unknown countri and there are few ordinari occas upon which fanci fret herself so much as in a situat like that of manner 
as the light grew faint and more faint and the morass appear blacker and blacker our travel question more close each chanc passeng on his distanc from the villag of kippletringan where he propos to quarter for the night 
his queri were usual answer by a counterchalleng respect the place from whenc he came 
while suffici daylight remain to show the dress and appear of a gentleman these cross interrogatori were usual put in the form of a case suppos as ‘ye’ll hae been at the auld abbey o’ halycross sir 
there’ moni english gentlemen gang to see that’or ‘your honour will becom frae the hous o’ pouderloupat’ but when the voic of the querist alon was distinguish the respons usual was ‘where are ye come frae at sic a time o’ night as the like o’ this’or ‘ye’ll no be o’ this countri freend’ the answer when obtain were neither veri reconcil to each other nor accur in the inform which they afford 
kippletringan was distant at first ‘a gey bit’ then the ‘gey bit’ was more accur describ as ‘ablin three mile’ then the ‘three mile’ diminish into ‘like a mile and a bittock’ then extend themselv into ‘four mile or thereawa’ and last a femal voic have hush a wail infant which the spokeswoman carri in her arm assur guy manner ‘it was a weari lang gate yet to kippletringan and unco heavi road for foot passengers’ the poor hack upon which manner was mount was probabl of opinion that it suit him as ill as the femal respond for he began to flag veri much answer each applic of the spur with a groan and stumbl at everi stone and they were not few which lay in his road 
manner now grew impati 
he was occasion betray into a deceit hope that the end of his journey was near by the apparit of a twinkl light or two but as he came up he was disappoint to find that the gleam proceed from some of those farmhous which occasion ornament the surfac of the extens bog 
at length to complet his perplex he arriv at a place where the road divid into two 
if there had been light to consult the relic of a fingerpost which stood there it would have been of littl avail as accord to the good custom of north britain the inscript had been defac short after it erect 
our adventur was therefor compel like a knighterr of old to trust to the sagac of his hors which without ani demur chose the lefthand path and seem to proceed at a somewhat liveli pace than befor afford therebi a hope that he knew he was draw near to his quarter for the even

hitherto noth had broken the silenc around him but the deep cri of the bogblitt or bullofthebog a larg speci of bittern and the sigh of the wind as it pass along the dreari morass 
to these was now join the distant roar of the ocean toward which the travel seem to be fast approach 
this was no circumst to make his mind easi 
mani of the road in that countri lay along the seabeach and were liabl to be flood by the tide which rise with great height and advanc with extrem rapid

they had made war rais rebellion been defeat behead and hang as becam a famili of import for mani centuri 
but they had gradual lost ground in the world and from be themselv the head of treason and traitor conspiraci the bertram or macdingawai of ellangowan had sunk into subordin accomplic 
their most fatal exhibit in this capac took place in the seventeenth centuri when the foul fiend possess them with a spirit of contradict which uniform involv them in controversi with the rule power

enlarg allan bertram of ellangowan who flourish tempor caroli primi was say my author sir robert dougla in his scottish baronag see the titl ‘ellangowan’ ‘a steadi loyalist and full of zeal for the caus of his sacr majesti in which he unit with the great marqui of montros and other truli zealous and honour patriot and sustain great loss in that behalf 
he had the honour of knighthood confer upon him by his most sacr majesti and was sequestr as a malign by the parliament 1642 and afterward as a resolution in the year 1648’ these two crossgrain epithet of malign and resolution cost poor sir allan one half of the famili estat

they were the first word which manner had heard him speak and as he had been watch with some curios when this eat drink move and smoke automaton would perform the part of speak he was a good deal divert with the harsh timber tone which issu from him

she was full six feet high wore a man’ greatcoat over the rest of her dress had in her hand a good sloethorn cudgel and in all point of equip except her petticoat seem rather masculin than feminin

or i will begin ab hora questioni as hali messahala ganwehi and guido bonatus have recommended’ one of sampson’ great recommend to the favour of mr bertram was that he never detect the most gross attempt at imposit so that the laird whose humbl effort at jocular were chiefli confin to what were then call bite and bam sinc denomin hoax and quizz had the fairest possibl subject of wit in the unsuspect domini 
it is true he never laugh or join in the laugh which his own simplic affordednay it is said he never laugh but onc in his life and on that memor occas his landladi miscarri part through surpris at the event itself and part from terror at the hideous grimac which attend this unusu cachinn 
the onli effect which the discoveri of such imposit produc upon this saturnin personag was to extort an ejacul of ‘prodigious’ or ‘veri facetious’ pronounc syllab but without move a muscl of his own counten 
on the present occas he turn a gaunt and ghast stare upon the youth astrolog and seem to doubt if he had right understood his answer to his patron 
‘i am afraid sir’ said manner turn toward him ‘you may be one of those unhappi person who their dim eye be unabl to penetr the starri sphere and to discern therein the decre of heaven at a distanc have their heart bar against convict by prejudic and misprision’ ‘truly’ said sampson ‘i opin with sir isaac newton knight and umwhil master of his majesty’ mint that the pretend scienc of astrolog is altogeth vain frivol and unsatisfactory’ and here he repos his oracular jaw 
‘really’ resum the travel ‘i am sorri to see a gentleman of your learn and graviti labour under such strang blind and delus

‘not so’ repli the young englishman ‘it is a general and wellground belief’ ‘it is the resourc of cheater knave and cozeners’ said sampson

coleridg from schiller the belief in astrolog was almost univers in the middl of the seventeenth centuri it began to waver and becom doubt toward the close of that period and in the begin of the eighteenth the art fell into general disreput and even under general ridicul 
yet it still retain mani partizan even in the seat of learn 
grave and studious men were loath to relinquish the calcul which had earli becom the princip object of their studi and felt reluct to descend from the predomin height to which a suppos insight into futur by the power of consult abstract influenc and conjunct had exalt them over the rest of mankind 
among those who cherish this imaginari privileg with undoubt faith was an old clergyman with whom manner was place dure his youth 
he wast his eye in observ the star and his brain in calcul upon their various combin 
his pupil in earli youth natur caught some portion of his enthusiasm and labour for a time to make himself master of the technic process of astrolog research so that befor he becam convinc of it absurd william lilli himself would have allow him ‘a curious fanci and pierc judgment in resolv a question of nativity’ on the present occas he aros as earli in the morn as the short of the day permit and proceed to calcul the nativ of the young heir of ellangowan 
he undertook the task secundum artem as well to keep up appear as from a sort of curios to know whether he yet rememb and could practis the imaginari scienc 
he accord erect his scheme or figur of heaven divid into it twelv hous place the planet therein accord to the ephemeri and rectifi their posit to the hour and moment of the nativ 
without troubl our reader with the general prognost which judici astrolog would have infer from these circumst in this diagram there was one signif which press remark upon our astrologer’ attent 
mar have digniti in the cusp of the twelfth hous threaten captiv or sudden and violent death to the nativ and manner have recours to those further rule by which divin pretend to ascertain the vehem of this evil direct observ from the result that three period would be particular hazardoushi fifth his tenth his twentyfirst year 
it was somewhat remark that manner had onc befor tri a similar piec of fooleri at the instanc of sophia wellwood the young ladi to whom he was attach and that a similar conjunct of planetari influenc threaten her with death or imprison in her thirtyninth year 
she was at this time eighteen so that accord to the result of the scheme in both case the same year threaten her with the same misfortun that was presag to the nativ or infant whom that night had introduc into the world 
struck with this coincid manner repeat his calcul and the result approxim the event predict until at length the same month and day of the month seem assign as the period of peril to both 
it will be readili believ that in mention this circumst we lay no weight whatev upon the pretend inform thus convey 
but it often happen such is our natur love for the marvel that we will contribut our own effort to beguil our better judgment 
whether the coincid which i have mention was realli one of those singular chanc which sometim happen against all ordinari calcul or whether manner bewild amid the arithmet labyrinth and technic jargon of astrolog had insens twice follow the same clue to guid him out of the maze or whether his imagin seduc by some point of appar resembl lent it aid to make the similitud between the two oper more exact accur than it might otherwis have been it is imposs to guess but the impress upon his mind that the result exact correspond was vivid and indel strong 
he could not help feel surpris at a coincid so singular and unexpect 
‘doe the devil mingl in the danc to aveng himself for our trifl with an art said to be of magic origin 
or is it possibl as bacon and sir thoma brown admit that there is some truth in a sober and regul astrolog and that the influenc of the star is not to be deni though the due applic of it by the knave who pretend to practis the art is great to be suspected’ a moment’ consider of the subject induc him to dismiss this opinion as fantast and onli sanction by those learn men either becaus they durst not at onc shock the univers prejudic of their age or becaus they themselv were not altogeth freed from the contagi influenc of a prevail superstit 
yet the result of his calcul in these two instanc left so unpleas an impress on his mind that like prospero he mental relinquish his art and resolv neither in jest nor earnest ever again to practis judici astrolog 
he hesit a good deal what he should say to the laird of ellangowan concern the horoscop of his firstborn and at length resolv plain to tell him the judgment which he had form at the same time acquaint him with the futil of the rule of art on which he had proceed 
with this resolut he walk out upon the terrac 
if the view of the scene around ellangowan had been pleas by moonlight it lost none of it beauti by the light of the morn sun 
the land even in the month of novemb smile under it influenc 
a steep but regular ascent led from the terrac to the neighbour emin and conduct manner to the front of the old castl 
it consist of two massiv round tower project deepli and dark at the extrem angl of a curtain or flat wall which unit them and thus protect the main entranc that open through a lofti arch in the centr of the curtain into the inner court of the castl 
the arm of the famili carv in freeston frown over the gateway and the portal show the space arrang by the architect for lower the portculli and rais the drawbridg 
a rude farmgat made of young firtre nail togeth now form the onli safeguard of this onc formid entranc 
the esplanad in front of the castl command a nobl prospect 
the dreari scene of desol through which mannering’ road had lain on the preced even was exclud from the view by some rise ground and the landscap show a pleas altern of hill and dale intersect by a river which was in some place visibl and hidden in other where it roll betwixt deep and wood bank 
the spire of a church and the appear of some hous indic the situat of a villag at the place where the stream had it junction with the ocean 
the vale seem well cultiv the littl inclosur into which they were divid skirt the bottom of the hill and sometim carri their line of straggl hedgerow a littl way up the ascent 
abov these were green pastur tenant chiefli by herd of black cattl then the stapl commod of the countri whose distant low gave no unpleas anim to the landscap 
the remot hill were of a sterner charact and at still greater distanc swell into mountain of dark heath border the horizon with a screen which gave a defin and limit boundari to the cultiv countri and ad at the same time the pleas idea that it was sequest and solitari 
the seacoast which manner now saw in it extent correspond in varieti and beauti with the inland view 
in some place it rose into tall rock frequent crown with the ruin of old build tower or beacon which accord to tradit were place within sight of each other that in time of invas or civil war they might communic by signal for mutual defenc and protect 
ellangowan castl was by far the most extens and import of these ruin and assert from size and situat the superior which it founder were said onc to have possess among the chief and nobl of the district 
in other place the shore was of a more gentl descript indent with small bay where the land slope smooth down or sent into the sea promontori cover with wood 
enlarg a scene so differ from what last night’ journey had presag produc a proport effect upon manner 
beneath his eye lay the modern housean awkward mansion inde in point of architectur but well situat and with a warm pleasant exposur 
‘how happily’ thought our hero ‘would life glide on in such a retir 
on the one hand the strike remnant of ancient grandeur with the secret conscious of famili pride which they inspir on the other enough of modern eleg and comfort to satisfi everi moder wish 
here then and with thee sophia’ we shall not pursu a lover’ daydream ani farther 
manner stood a minut with his arm fold and then turn to the ruin castl 
on enter the gateway he found that the rude magnific of the inner court ampli correspond with the grandeur of the exterior 
on the one side ran a rang of window lofti and larg divid by carv mullion of stone which had onc light the great hall of the castl on the other were various build of differ height and date yet so unit as to present to the eye a certain general effect of uniform of front 
the door and window were ornament with project exhibit rude specimen of sculptur and traceri part entir and part broken down part cover by ivi and trail plant which grew luxuri among the ruin 
that end of the court which face the entranc had also been former close by a rang of build but owe it was said to it have been batter by the ship of the parliament under dean dure the long civil war this part of the castl was much more ruinous than the rest and exhibit a great chasm through which manner could observ the sea and the littl vessel an arm lugger which retain her station in the centr of the bay 
footnot the outlin of the abov descript as far as the suppos ruin are concern will be found somewhat to resembl the nobl remain of carlaverock castl six or seven mile from dumfri and near to lochar moss 
while manner was gaze round the ruin he heard from the interior of an apart on the left hand the voic of the gipsi he had seen on the preced even 
he soon found an apertur through which he could observ her without be himself visibl and could not help feel that her figur her employ and her situat convey the exact impress of an ancient sibyl 
she sate upon a broken cornerston in the angl of a pave apart part of which she had swept clean to afford a smooth space for the evolut of her spindl 
a strong sunbeam through a lofti and narrow window fell upon her wild dress and featur and afford her light for her occup the rest of the apart was veri gloomi 
equipt in a habit which mingl the nation dress of the scottish common peopl with someth of an eastern costum she spun a thread drawn from wool of three differ colour black white and grey by assist of those ancient implement of housewiferi now almost banish from the land the distaff and spindl

ere our translat or rather our free imit had arrang these stanza in his head and while he was yet hammer out a rhyme for dwindl the task of the sibyl was accomplish or her wool was expend 
she took the spindl now charg with her labour and undo the thread gradual measur it by cast it over her elbow and bring each loop round between her forefing and thumb

when the boat which carri the worthi captain on board his vessel had accomplish that task the sail began to ascend and the ship was got under way 
she fire three gun as a salut to the hous of ellangowan and then shot away rapid befor the wind which blew off shore under all the sail she could crowd 
‘ay ay’ said the laird who had sought manner for some time and now join him ‘there they gother go the freetradersther go captain dirk hatteraick and the yungfrauw hagenslaapen half mank half dutchman half devil

the tea which of cours belong to the nobl captain hatteraick’ trade was pronounc excel 
still manner hint though with due delicaci at the risk of encourag such desper charact 
‘were it but in justic to the revenu i should have supposed’ ‘ah the revenu lads’for mr bertram never embrac a general or abstract idea and his notion of the revenu was personifi in the commission surveyor comptrol and ride offic whom he happen to know’th revenu lad can look sharp eneugh out for themselv no ane need to help them and they have a’ the soldier to assist them besid and as to justiceyou ‘ll be surpris to hear it mr manner but i am not a justic of peace’ manner assum the expect look of surpris but thought within himself that the worship bench suffer no great depriv from want the assist of his goodhumour landlord 
mr bertram had now hit upon one of the few subject on which he felt sore and went on with some energi 
‘no sir the name of godfrey bertram of ellangowan is not in the last commiss though there’ scarc a carl in the countri that has a ploughgat of land but what he must ride to quartersess and write jp after his name 
i ken fu’ weel whom i am oblig tosir thoma kittlecourt as good as tell’d me he would sit in my skirt if he had not my interest at the last elect and becaus i chose to go with my own blood and third cousin the laird of balrudderi they keepit me off the roll of freehold and now there come a new nomin of justic and i am left out

‘and then mr manner there was the stori about the road and the faulddik 
i ken sir thoma was behind there and i said plain to the clerk to the truste that i saw the cloven foot let them take that as they like 
would ani gentleman or set of gentlemen go and drive a road right through the corner of a faulddik and take away as my agent observ to them like twa rood of gude moorland pastur 
and there was the stori about choos the collector of the cess’ ‘certain sir it is hard you should meet with ani neglect in a countri where to judg from the extent of their resid your ancestor must have made a veri import figure’ ‘veri true mr manner i am a plain man and do not dwell on these thing and i must need say i have littl memori for them but i wish ye could have heard my father’ stori about the auld fight of the macdingawaiesthat’ the bertram that now iswi’ the irish and wi’ the highland that came here in their berl from ilay and cantir and how they went to the holi landthat is to jerusalem and jericho wi’ a’ their clan at their heelsthey had better have gaen to jamaica like sir thoma kittlecourt’ uncleand how they brought hame relic like those that cathol have and a flag that’ up yonder in the garret

but ye make no breakfast mr manner ye’r no eat your meat allow me to recommend some of the kipper 
it was john hay that catcht it saturday was three week down at the stream below hempse ford’ etc 
etc 
etc 
the laird whose indign had for some time kept him pretti steadi to one topic now launch forth into his usual rove style of convers which gave manner ampl time to reflect upon the disadvantag attend the situat which an hour befor he had thought worthi of so much envi 
here was a countri gentleman whose most estim qualiti seem his perfect goodnatur secret fret himself and murmur against other for caus which compar with ani real evil in life must weigh like dust in the balanc

curious to investig the manner of the countri manner took the advantag of a paus in good mr bertram’ string of stori to inquir what captain hatteraick so earnest want with the gipsi woman 
‘o to bless his ship i suppos 
you must know mr manner that these freetrad whom the law call smuggler have no religion make it all up in superstit and they have as mani spell and charm and nonsense’ ‘vaniti and waur’ said the dominie’ it is a traffick with the evil one

manner cannot get in a word for ye 
and so mr manner talk of astronomi and spell and these matter have ye been so kind as to consid what we were speak about last night’ ‘i begin to think mr bertram with your worthi friend here that i have been rather jest with edgetool and although neither you nor i nor ani sensibl man can put faith in the predict of astrolog yet as it has sometim happen that inquiri into futur undertaken in jest have in their result produc serious and unpleas effect both upon action and charact i realli wish you would dispens with my repli to your question’ it was easi to see that this evas answer onli render the laird’ curios more uncontrol 
manner howev was determin in his own mind not to expos the infant to the inconveni which might have arisen from his be suppos the object of evil predict 
he therefor deliv the paper into mr bertram’ hand and request him to keep it for five year with the seal unbroken until the month of novemb was expir 
after that date had interven he left him at liberti to examin the write trust that the first fatal period be then safe overpass no credit would be paid to it farther content 
this mr bertram was content to promis and manner to ensur his fidel hint at misfortun which would certain take place if his injunct were neglect 
the rest of the day which manner by mr bertram’ invit spent at ellangowan pass over without anyth remark and on the morn of that which follow the travel mount his palfrey bade a courteous adieu to his hospit landlord and to his cleric attend repeat his good wish for the prosper of the famili and then turn his horse’ head toward england disappear from the sight of the inmat of ellangowan 
he must also disappear from that of our reader for it is to anoth and later period of his life that the present narrat relat 
chapter vi next the justic in fair round belli with good capon line with eye sever and beard of formal cut full of wise saw and modern instanc and so he play his part as you like it when mrs bertram of ellangowan was abl to hear the news of what had pass dure her confin her apart rung with all manner of gossip respect the handsom young student from oxford who had told such a fortun by the star to the young laird ‘bless on his dainti face’ the form accent and manner of the stranger were expati upon 
his hors bridl saddl and stirrup did not remain unnot 
all this made a great impress upon the mind of mrs bertram for the good ladi had no small store of superstit 
her first employ when she becam capabl of a littl work was to make a small velvet bag for the scheme of nativ which she had obtain from her husband 
her finger itch to break the seal but credul prove stronger than curios and she had the firm to inclos it in all it integr within two slip of parchment which she sew round it to prevent it be chafe 
the whole was then put into the velvet bag aforesaid and hung as a charm round the neck of the infant where his mother resolv it should remain until the period for the legitim satisfact of her curios should arriv 
the father also resolv to do his part by the child in secur him a good educ and with the view that it should commenc with the first dawn of reason domini sampson was easili induc to renounc his public profess of parish schoolmast make his constant resid at the place and in consider of a sum not quit equal to the wage of a footman even at that time to undertak to communic to the futur laird of ellangowan all the erudit which he had and all the grace and accomplish whichh had not inde but which he had never discov that he want 
in this arrang the laird found also his privat advantag secur the constant benefit of a patient auditor to whom he told his stori when they were alon and at whose expens he could break a sli jest when he had compani 
about four year after this time a great commot took place in the counti where ellangowan is situat 
those who watch the sign of the time had long been of opinion that a chang of ministri was about to take place and at length after a due proport of hope fear and delay rumour from good author and bad author and no author at all after some club had drank up with this statesman and other down with him after ride and run and post and address and counteraddress and proffer of live and fortun the blow was at length struck the administr of the day was dissolv and parliament as a natur consequ was dissolv also

he was a partizan of the old administr and the friend of the new had alreadi set about an activ canvass in behalf of john featherhead esq who kept the best hound and hunter in the shire 
among other who join the standard of revolt was gilbert glossin writer in agent for the laird of ellangowan 
this honest gentleman had either been refus some favour by the old member or what is as probabl he had got all that he had the most distant pretens to ask and could onli look to the other side for fresh advanc 
mr glossin had a vote upon ellangowan’ properti and he was now determin that his patron should have one also there be no doubt which side mr bertram would embrac in the contest 
he easili persuad ellangowan that it would be credit to him to take the field at the head of as strong a parti as possibl and immedi went to work make vote as everi scotch lawyer know how by split and subdivid the superior upon this ancient and onc power baroni 
these were so extens that by dint of clip and pare here ad and eke there and creat overlord upon all the estat which bertram held of the crown they advanc at the day of contest at the head of ten as good men of parchment as ever took the oath of trust and possess 
this strong reinforc turn the dubious day of battl 
the princip and his agent divid the honour the reward fell to the latter exclus 
mr gilbert glossin was made clerk of the peac and godfrey bertram had his name insert in a new commiss of justic issu immedi upon the sit of the parliament 
this had been the summit of mr bertram’ ambit not that he like either the troubl or the respons of the offic but he thought it was a digniti to which he was well entitl and that it had been withheld from him by malic prepens 
but there is an old and true scotch proverb ‘fool should not have chap sticks’ that is weapon of offenc 
mr bertram was no sooner possess of the judici author which he had so much long for than he began to exercis it with more sever than merci and total beli all the opinion which had hitherto been form of his inert goodnatur 
we have read somewher of a justic of peac who on be nomin in the commiss wrote a letter to a booksel for the statut respect his offici duti in the follow orthography’pleas send the ax relat to a gustus pease’ no doubt when this learn gentleman had possess himself of the axe he hew the law with it to some purpos 
mr bertram was not quit so ignor of english grammar as his worship predecessor but augustus peas himself could not have use more indiscrimin the weapon unwarili put into his hand 
in good earnest he consid the commiss with which he had been entrust as a person mark of favour from his sovereign forget that he had former thought his be depriv of a privileg or honour common to those of his rank was the result of mere parti cabal 
he command his trusti aiddecamp domini sampson to read aloud the commiss and at the first word ‘the king has been pleas to appoint’’pleased’ he exclaim in a transport of gratitud ‘honest gentleman 
i’m sure he cannot be better pleas than i am’ accord unwil to confin his gratitud to mere feel or verbal express he gave full current to the newborn zeal of offic and endeavour to express his sens of the honour confer upon him by an unmitig activ in the discharg of his duti 
new broom it is said sweep clean and i myself can bear wit that on the arriv of a new housemaid the ancient hereditari and domest spider who have spun their web over the lower divis of my bookshelv consist chiefli of law and divin dure the peac reign of her predecessor fli at full speed befor the probationari inroad of the new mercenari 
even so the laird of ellangowan ruthless commenc his magisteri reform at the expens of various establish and superannu picker and stealer who had been his neighbour for half a centuri 
he wrought his miracl like a second duke humphrey and by the influenc of the beadle’ rod caus the lame to walk the blind to see and the palsi to labour 
he detect poacher blackfish orchardbreak and pigeonshoot had the applaus of the bench for his reward and the public credit of an activ magistr 
all this good had it rateabl proport of evil 
even an admit nuisanc of ancient stand should not be abat without some caution 
the zeal of our worthi friend now involv in great distress sundri personag whose idl and mendic habit his own lachess had contribut to foster until these habit had becom irreclaim or whose real incapac for exert render them fit object in their own phrase for the chariti of all welldispos christian 
the ‘longrememb beggar’ who for twenti year had made his regular round within the neighbourhood receiv rather as an humbl friend than as an object of chariti was sent to the neighbour workhous 
the decrepit dame who travel round the parish upon a handbarrow circul from hous to hous like a bad shill which everi one is in hast to pass to his neighboursh who use to call for her bearer as loud or louder than a travel demand posthorseseven she share the same disastr fate 
the ‘daft jock’ who half knave half idiot had been the sport of each succeed race of villag children for a good part of a centuri was remit to the counti bridewel where seclud from free air and sunshin the onli advantag he was capabl of enjoy he pine and die in the cours of six month 
the old sailor who had so long rejoic the smoki rafter of everi kitchen in the countri by sing ‘captain ward’ and ‘bold admir benbow’ was banish from the counti for no better reason than that he was suppos to speak with a strong irish accent 
even the annual round of the pedlar were abolish by the justic in his hasti zeal for the administr of rural polic 
these thing did not pass without notic and censur 
we are not made of wood or stone and the thing which connect themselv with our heart and habit cannot like bark or lichen be rent away without our miss them 
the farmer’ dame lack her usual share of intellig perhap also the selfapplaus which she had felt while distribut the awmous alm in shape of a gowpen hand of oatmeal to the mendic who brought the news 
the cottag felt inconveni from interrupt of the petti trade carri on by the itiner dealer 
the children lack their suppli of sugarplum and toy the young women want pin ribbon comb and ballad and the old could no longer barter their egg for salt snuff and tobacco 
all these circumst brought the busi laird of ellangowan into discredit which was the more general on account of his former popular 
even his lineag was brought up in judgment against him 
they thought ‘naeth of what the like of greensid or burnvill or viewforth might do that were stranger in the countri but ellangowan 
that had been a name amang them sinc the mirk monanday and lang beforehim to be grind the puir at that rate

and the leddi on ilka christma night as it came round gae twelv siller penni to ilka puir bodi about in honour of the twelv apostl like 
they were fond to ca’ it papistri but i think our great folk might take a lesson frae the papist while 
they gie anoth sort o’ help to puir folk than just ding down a saxpenc in the brod on the sabbath and kilt and scourg and drum them a’ the sax day o’ the week besides’ such was the gossip over the good twopenni in everi alehous within three or four mile of ellangowan that be about the diamet of the orbit in which our friend godfrey bertram esq j p must be consid as the princip luminari 
still greater scope was given to evil tongu by the remov of a coloni of gipsi with one of whom our reader is somewhat acquaint and who had for a great mani year enjoy their chief settlement upon the estat of ellangowan 
chapter vii come princ of the rag regiment you of the blood 
prig my most upright lord and these what name or titl e’er they bear jarkman or patrico crank or clapperdudgeon prater or abrammani speak of all 
beggar’ bush 
although the charact of those gipsi tribe which former inund most of the nation of europ and which in some degre still subsist among them as a distinct peopl is general understood the reader will pardon my say a few word respect their situat in scotland 
it is well known that the gipsi were at an earli period acknowledg as a separ and independ race by one of the scottish monarch and that they were less favour distinguish by a subsequ law which render the charact of gipsi equal in the judici balanc to that of common and habitu thief and prescrib his punish accord 
notwithstand the sever of this and other statut the fratern prosper amid the distress of the countri and receiv larg access from among those whom famin oppress or the sword of war had depriv of the ordinari mean of subsist 
they lost in a great measur by this intermixtur the nation charact of egyptian and becam a mingl race have all the idl and predatori habit of their eastern ancestor with a feroc which they probabl borrow from the men of the north who join their societi 
they travel in differ band and had rule among themselv by which each tribe was confin to it own district 
the slightest invas of the precinct which had been assign to anoth tribe produc desper skirmish in which there was often much blood shed 
the patriot fletcher of saltoun drew a pictur of these banditti about a centuri ago which my reader will perus with astonish ‘there are at this day in scotland besid a great mani poor famili veri mean provid for by the church box with other who by live on bad food fall into various diseas two hundr thousand peopl beg from door to door 
these are not onli no way advantag but a veri grievous burden to so poor a countri 
and though the number of them be perhap doubl to what it was former by reason of this present great distress yet in all time there have been about one hundr thousand of those vagabond who have live without ani regard or subject either to the law of the land or even those of god and natur 


no magistr could ever discov or be inform which way one in a hundr of these wretch die or that ever they were baptiz 
mani murder have been discov among them and they are not onli a most unspeak oppress to poor tenant who if they give not bread or some kind of provis to perhap forti such villain in one day are sure to be insult by them but they rob mani poor peopl who live in hous distant from ani neighbourhood 
in year of plenti mani thousand of them meet togeth in the mountain where they feast and riot for mani day and at countri wed market burial and other the like public occas they are to be seen both man and woman perpetu drunk curs blasphem and fight together’ notwithstand the deplor pictur present in this extract and which fletcher himself though the energet and eloqu friend of freedom saw no better mode of correct than by introduc a system of domest slaveri the progress of time and increas both of the mean of life and of the power of the law gradual reduc this dread evil within more narrow bound 
the tribe of gipsi jocki or cairdsfor by all these denomin such banditti were knownbecam few in number and mani were entir root out 
still howev a suffici number remain to give occasion alarm and constant vexat 
some rude handicraft were entir resign to these itiner particular the art of trenchermak of manufactur hornspoon and the whole mysteri of the tinker 
to these they ad a petti trade in the coars sort of earthenwar 
such were their ostens mean of livelihood 
each tribe had usual some fix place of rendezv which they occasion occupi and consid as their stand camp and in the vicin of which they general abstain from depred 
they had even talent and accomplish which made them occasion use and entertain 
mani cultiv music with success and the favourit fiddler or piper of a district was often to be found in a gipsi town 
they understood all outofdoor sport especi otterhunt fish or find game 
they bred the best and boldest terrier and sometim had good pointer for sale 
in winter the women told fortun the men show trick of legerdemain and these accomplish often help to while away a weari or stormi even in the circl of the ‘farmer’ ha’’ the wild of their charact and the indomit pride with which they despis all regular labour command a certain awe which was not diminish by the consider that these stroller were a vindict race and were restrain by no check either of fear or conscienc from take desper vengeanc upon those who had offend them 
these tribe were in short the pariah of scotland live like wild indian among european settler and like them judg of rather by their own custom habit and opinion than as if they had been member of the civilis part of the communiti 
some hord of them yet remain chiefli in such situat as afford a readi escap either into a wast countri or into anoth jurisdict 
nor are the featur of their charact much soften 
their number howev are so great diminish that instead of one hundr thousand as calcul by fletcher it would now perhap be imposs to collect abov five hundr throughout all scotland 
a tribe of these itiner to whom meg merrili appertain had long been as stationari as their habit permit in a glen upon the estat of ellangowan 
they had there erect a few hut which they denomin their ‘citi of refuge’ and where when not absent on excurs they harbour unmolest as the crow that roost in the old ashtre around them 
they had been such long occup that they were consid in some degre as proprietor of the wretch sheal which they inhabit 
this protect they were said ancient to have repaid by servic to the laird in war or more frequent by infest or plunder the land of those neighbour baron with whom he chanc to be at feud 
latter their servic were of a more pacif natur 
the women spun mitten for the ladi and knit boothos for the laird which were annual present at christma with great form 
the age sibyl bless the bridal bed of the laird when he marri and the cradl of the heir when born 
the men repair her ladyship’ crack china and assist the laird in his sport parti worm his dog and cut the ear of his terrier puppi 
the children gather nut in the wood and cranberri in the moss and mushroom on the pastur for tribut to the place 
these act of voluntari servic and acknowledg of depend were reward by protect on some occas conniv on other and broken victual ale and brandi when circumst call for a display of generos and this mutual intercours of good offic which had been carri on for at least two centuri render the inhabit of derncleugh a kind of privileg retain upon the estat of ellangowan 
‘the knaves’ were the laird’ ‘exceed good friends’ and he would have deem himself veri ill use if his counten could not now and then have born them out against the law of the countri and the local magistr 
but this friend union was soon to be dissolv 
the communiti of derncleugh who care for no rogu but their own were wholli without alarm at the sever of the justice’ proceed toward other itiner 
they had no doubt that he determin to suffer no mendic or stroller in the countri but what resid on his own properti and practis their trade by his immedi permiss impli or express 
nor was mr bertram in a hurri to exert his newlyacquir author at the expens of these old settler 
but he was driven on by circumst 
at the quartersess our new justic was public upbraid by a gentleman of the opposit parti in counti polit that while he affect a great zeal for the public polic and seem ambiti of the fame of an activ magistr he foster a tribe of the greatest rogu in the countri and permit them to harbour within a mile of the hous of ellangowan 
to this there was no repli for the fact was too evid and well known 
the laird digest the taunt as he best could and in his way home amus himself with specul on the easiest method of rid himself of these vagrant who brought a stain upon his fair fame as a magistr 
just as he had resolv to take the first opportun of quarrel with the pariah of derncleugh a caus of provoc present itself 
sinc our friend’ advanc to be a conserv of the peac he had caus the gate at the head of his avenu which former have onli one hing remain at all time hospit openh had caus this gate i say to be newli hung and handsom paint 
he had also shut up with pale curious twist with furz certain hole in the fenc adjoin through which the gipsi boy use to scrambl into the plantat to gather birds’ nest the senior of the villag to make a short cut from one point to anoth and the lad and lass for even rendezvousal without offenc taken or leav ask 
but these halcyon day were now to have an end and a minatori inscript on one side of the gate intim ‘prosecut accord to law’ the painter had spelt it ‘persecution’l’un vaut bien l’autr to all who should be found trespass on these inclosur 
on the other side for uniformity’ sake was a precautionari annunci of springgun and mantrap of such formid power that said the rubrick with an emphat nota bene’if a man goe in they will break a horse’ leg’ in defianc of these threat six wellgrown gipsi boy and girl were ride cockhors upon the new gate and plait mayflow which it was but too evid had been gather within the forbidden precinct 
with as much anger as he was capabl of feel or perhap of assum the laird command them to descendthey paid no attent to his mandat he then began to pull them down one after anotherthey resist passiv at least each sturdi bronz varlet make himself as heavi as he could or climb up as fast as he was dismount 
the laird then call in the assist of his servant a sur fellow who had immedi recours to his horsewhip 
a few lash sent the parti ascamp and thus commenc the first breach of the peac between the hous of ellangowan and the gipsi of derncleugh 
the latter could not for some time imagin that the war was real until they found that their children were horsewhip by the griev when found trespass that their ass were poind by the groundoffic when left in the plantat or even when turn to graze by the roadsid against the provis of the turnpik act that the constabl began to make curious inquiri into their mode of gain a livelihood and express his surpris that the men should sleep in the hovel all day and be abroad the greater part of the night 
when matter came to this point the gipsi without scrupl enter upon measur of retali 
ellangowan’ henroost were plunder his linen stolen from the line or bleachingground his fish poach his dog kidnap his grow tree cut or bark 
much petti mischief was done and some evid for the mischief’ sake 
on the other hand warrant went forth without merci to pursu search for take and apprehend and notwithstand their dexter one or two of the depred were unabl to avoid convict 
one a stout young fellow who sometim had gone to sea afish was hand over to the captain of the impress servic at d two children were sound flog and one egyptian matron sent to the hous of correct 
still howev the gipsi made no motion to leav the spot which they had so long inhabit and mr bertram felt an unwilling to depriv them of their ancient ‘citi of refuge’ so that the petti warfar we have notic continu for sever month without increas or abat of hostil on either side 
chapter viii so the red indian by ontario’ side nurs hardi on the brindl panther’ hide as fade his swarthi race with anguish see the white man’ cottag rise beneath the tree he leav the shelter of his nativ wood he leav the murmur of ohio’ flood and forward rush in indign grief where never foot has trod the fallen leaf he bend his cours where twilight reign sublim

in trace the rise and progress of the scottish maroon war we must not omit to mention that year had roll on and that littl harri bertram one of the hardiest and most live children that ever made a sword and grenadier’ cap of rush now approach his fifth revolv birthday 
a hardihood of disposit which earli develop itself made him alreadi a littl wander he was well acquaint with everi patch of lea ground and dingl around ellangowan and could tell in his broken languag upon what baulk grew the bonniest flower and what cops had the ripest nut 
he repeat terrifi his attend by clamber about the ruin of the old castl and had more than onc made a stolen excurs as far as the gipsi hamlet 
on these occas he was general brought back by meg merrili who though she could not be prevail upon to enter the place of ellangowan after her nephew had been given up to the pressgang did not appar extend her resent to the child 
on the contrari she often contriv to waylay him in his walk sing him a gipsi song give him a ride upon her jackass and thrust into his pocket a piec of gingerbread or a redcheek appl 
this woman’ ancient attach to the famili repel and check in everi other direct seem to rejoic in have some object on which it could yet repos and expand itself 
she prophesi a hundr time ‘that young mr harri would be the pride o’ the famili and there hadna been sic a sprout frae the auld aik sinc the death of arthur macdingawai that was kill in the battl o’ the bloodi bay as for the present stick it was good for noth but firewood’ on one occas when the child was ill she lay all night below the window chant a rhyme which she believ sovereign as a febrifug and could neither be prevail upon to enter the hous nor to leav the station she had chosen till she was inform that the crisi was over 
the affect of this woman becam matter of suspicion not inde to the laird who was never hasti in suspect evil but to his wife who had indiffer health and poor spirit 
she was now far advanc in a second pregnanc and as she could not walk abroad herself and the woman who attend upon harri was young and thoughtless she pray domini sampson to undertak the task of watch the boy in his rambl when he should not be otherwis accompani 
the domini love his young charg and was enraptur with his own success in have alreadi brought him so far in his learn as to spell word of three syllabl 
the idea of this earli prodigi of erudit be carri off by the gipsi like a second adam smithfootnot the father of econom philosophi was when a child actual carri off by gipsi and remain some hour in their possess 
was not to be toler and accord though the charg was contrari to all his habit of life he readili undertook it and might be seen stalk about with a mathemat problem in his head and his eye upon a child of five year old whose rambl led him into a hundr awkward situat 
twice was the domini chase by a crossgrain cow onc he fell into the brook cross at the steppingston and anoth time was bog up to the middl in the slough of lochend in attempt to gather a waterlili for the young laird 
it was the opinion of the villag matron who reliev sampson on the latter occas ‘that the laird might as weel trust the care o’ his bairn to a potato bogle’ but the good domini bore all his disast with graviti and seren equal imperturb 
‘prodigious’ was the onli ejacul they ever extort from the muchendur man 
enlarg the laird had by this time determin to make rootandbranch work with the maroon of derncleugh 
the old servant shook their head at his propos and even domini sampson ventur upon an indirect remonstr 
as howev it was couch in the oracular phrase ‘ne movea camerinam’ neither the allus nor the languag in which it was express were calcul for mr bertram’ edif and matter proceed against the gipsi in form of law 
everi door in the hamlet was chalk by the groundoffic in token of a formal warn to remov at next term 
still howev they show no symptom either of submiss or of complianc 
at length the termday the fatal martinma arriv and violent measur of eject were resort to 
a strong poss of peaceoffic suffici to render all resist vain charg the inhabit to depart by noon and as they did not obey the offic in term of their warrant proceed to unroof the cottag and pull down the wretch door and windowsa summari and effectu mode of eject still practis in some remot part of scotland when a tenant prove refractori 
the gipsi for a time beheld the work of destruct in sullen silenc and inact then set about saddl and load their ass and make prepar for their departur 
these were soon accomplish where all had the habit of wander tartar and they set forth on their journey to seek new settlement where their patron should neither be of the quorum nor custo rotulorum 
certain qualm of feel had deter ellangowan from attend in person to see his tenant expel 
he left the execut part of the busi to the offic of the law under the immedi direct of frank kennedi a supervisor or ridingoffic belong to the excis who had of late becom intim at the place and of whom we shall have more to say in the next chapter 
mr bertram himself chose that day to make a visit to a friend at some distanc 
but it so happen notwithstand his precaut that he could not avoid meet his late tenant dure their retreat from his properti 
it was in a hollow way near the top of a steep ascent upon the verg of the ellangowan estat that mr bertram met the gipsi process 
four or five men form the advanc guard wrap in long loos greatcoat that hid their tall slender figur as the larg slouch hat drawn over their brow conceal their wild featur dark eye and swarthi face 
two of them carri long fowlingpiec one wore a broadsword without a sheath and all had the highland dirk though they did not wear that weapon open or ostentati 
behind them follow the train of laden ass and small cart or tumbler as they were call in that countri on which were laid the decrepit and the helpless the age and infant part of the exil communiti 
the women in their red cloak and straw hat the elder children with bare head and bare feet and almost nake bodi had the immedi care of the littl caravan 
the road was narrow run between two broken bank of sand and mr bertram’ servant rode forward smack his whip with an air of author and motion to the driver to allow free passag to their better 
his signal was unattend to 
he then call to the men who loung idl on befor ‘stand to your beasts’ head and make room for the laird to pass’ ‘he shall have his share of the road’ answer a male gipsi from under his slouch and largebrim hat and without rais his face ‘and he shall have nae mair the highway is as free to our cuddi as to his gelding’ the tone of the man be sulki and even menac mr bertram thought it best to put his digniti in his pocket and pass by the process quiet on such space as they chose to leav for his accommod which was narrow enough 
to cover with an appear of indiffer his feel of the want of respect with which he was treat he address one of the men as he pass him without ani show of greet salut or recognition’gil baillie’ he said ‘have you heard that your son gabriel is well’ the question respect the young man who had been press 
‘if i had heard otherwise’ said the old man look up with a stern and menac counten ‘you should have heard of it too’ and he plod on his way tarri no further question 
footnot this anecdot is a liter fact 
when the laird had press on with difficulti among a crowd of familiar face which had on all former occas mark his approach with the rever due to that of a superior be but in which he now onli read hatr and contempt and had got clear of the throng he could not help turn his hors and look back to mark the progress of their march 
the group would have been an excel subject for the pencil of calott 
the van had alreadi reach a small and stunt thicket which was at the bottom of the hill and which gradual hid the line of march until the last straggler disappear 
his sensat were bitter enough 
the race it is true which he had thus summarili dismiss from their ancient place of refug was idl and vicious but had he endeavour to render them otherwis 
they were not more irregular charact now than they had been while they were admit to consid themselv as a sort of subordin depend of his famili and ought the mere circumst of his becom a magistr to have made at onc such a chang in his conduct toward them 
some mean of reform ought at least to have been tri befor send seven famili at onc upon the wide world and depriv them of a degre of counten which withheld them at least from atroci guilt 
there was also a natur yearn of heart on part with so mani known and familiar face and to this feel godfrey bertram was peculiar access from the limit qualiti of his mind which sought it princip amus among the petti object around him 
as he was about to turn his horse’ head to pursu his journey meg merrili who had lag behind the troop unexpect present herself 
she was stand upon one of those high precipit bank which as we befor notic overhung the road so that she was place consider higher than ellangowan even though he was on horseback and her tall figur reliev against the clear blue sky seem almost of supernatur statur 
we have notic that there was in her general attir or rather in her mode of adjust it somewhat of a foreign costum art adopt perhap for the purpos of ad to the effect of her spell and predict or perhap from some tradit notion respect the dress of her ancestor 
on this occas she had a larg piec of red cotton cloth roll about her head in the form of a turban from beneath which her dark eye flash with uncommon lustr 
her long and tangl black hair fell in elflock from the fold of this singular headgear 
her attitud was that of a sibyl in frenzi and she stretch out in her right hand a sapl bough which seem just pull 
‘i’ll be dd’ said the groom ‘if she has not been cut the young ash in the dukit park’ the laird made no answer but continu to look at the figur which was thus perch abov his path 
‘ride your ways’ said the gipsi ‘ride your way laird of ellangowan ride your way godfrey bertram 
this day have ye quench seven smoke hearth see if the fire in your ain parlour burn the blyther for that

margaret of anjou bestow on her triumphant foe her keenedg maledict could not have turn from them with a gestur more proud contemptu 
the laird was clear his voic to speak and thrust his hand in his pocket to find a halfcrown the gipsi wait neither for his repli nor his donat but strode down the hill to overtak the caravan 
ellangowan rode pensiv home and it was remark that he did not mention this interview to ani of his famili 
the groom was not so reserv he told the stori at great length to a full audienc in the kitchen and conclud by swear that ‘if ever the devil spoke by the mouth of a woman he had spoken by that of meg merrili that bless day’ chapter ix paint scotland greet ower her thrissl her mutchkin stoup as toom’ a whistl and dn’d excisemen in a bustl seiz a stell triumphant crushin’t like a mussel or lampit shell burn

there was at this period employ as a ridingoffic or supervisor in that part of the countri a certain franci kennedi alreadi name in our narrativea stout resolut and activ man who had made seizur to a great amount and was proport hate by those who had an interest in the fair trade as they call the pursuit of these contraband adventur 
this person was natur son to a gentleman of good famili owe to which circumst and to his be of a jolli convivi disposit and sing a good song he was admit to the occasion societi of the gentlemen of the countri and was a member of sever of their club for practis athlet game at which he was particular expert

his vivac reliev mr bertram of the troubl of thought and the labour which it cost him to support a detail communic of idea while the dare and danger exploit which he had undertaken in the discharg of his offic form excel convers 
to all these revenu adventur did the laird of ellangowan serious inclin and the amus which he deriv from kennedy’ societi form an excel reason for countenanc and assist the narrat in the execut of his invidi and hazard duti 
‘frank kennedy’ he said ‘was a gentleman though on the wrang side of the blanket he was connect with the famili of ellangowan through the hous of glengubbl 
the last laird of glengubbl would have brought the estat into the ellangowan line but happen to go to harrig he there met with miss jean hadawaybi the by the green dragon at harrig is the best hous of the twabut for frank kennedi he’ in one sens a gentleman born and it’ a shame not to support him against these blackguard smugglers’ after this leagu had taken place between judgment and execut it chanc that captain dirk hatteraick had land a cargo of spirit and other contraband good upon the beach not far from ellangowan and confid in the indiffer with which the laird had former regard similar infract of the law he was neither veri anxious to conceal nor to expedit the transact 
the consequ was that mr frank kennedi arm with a warrant from ellangowan and support by some of the laird’ peopl who knew the countri and by a parti of militari pour down upon the keg bale and bag and after a desper affray in which sever wound were given and receiv succeed in clap the broad arrow upon the articl and bear them off in triumph to the next customhous 
dirk hatteraick vow in dutch german and english a deep and full reveng both against the gauger and his abettor and all who knew him thought it like he would keep his word 
a few day after the departur of the gipsi tribe mr bertram ask his ladi one morn at breakfast whether this was not littl harry’ birthday 
‘five year auld exact this bless day’ answer the ladi ‘so we may look into the english gentleman’ paper’ mr bertram like to show his author in trifl 
‘no my dear not till tomorrow 
the last time i was at quartersess the sheriff told us that diesthat die inceptusin short you don’t understand latin but it mean that a termday is not begun till it’ ended’ ‘that sound like nonsens my dear’ ‘may be so my dear but it may be veri good law for all that

and i wonder at you laird for meddl and make 
did we ever want to send for tea or brandi frae the boroughtown when dirk hatteraick use to come quiet into the bay’ ‘mrs 
bertram you know noth of these matter 
do you think it becom a magistr to let his own hous be made a receptacl for smuggl good 
frank kennedi will show you the penalti in the act and ye ken yoursel they use to put their run good into the auld place of ellangowan up by there’ ‘oh dear mr bertram and what the waur were the wa’ and the vault o’ the auld castl for have a whin keg o’ brandi in them at an orra time 
i am sure ye were not oblig to ken oni thing about it and what the waur was the king that the laird here got a soup o’ drink and the ladi their drap o’ tea at a reason rateit’ a shame to them to pit such tax on themand was na i much the better of these flander head and pinner that dirk hatteraick sent me a’ the way from antwerp

and then ye would quarrel with these gipsi too 
i expect everi day to hear the barnyard’ in a low’ ‘i tell you onc more my dear you don’t understand these thingsand there’ frank kennedi come gallop up the avenue’ ‘aweel 
aweel 
ellangowan’ said the ladi rais her voic as the laird left the room ‘i wish ye may understand them yoursel that’ a’’ from this nuptial dialogu the laird joy escap to meet his faith friend mr kennedi who arriv in high spirit 
‘for the love of life ellangowan’ he said ‘get up to the castl 
you’ll see that old fox dirk hatteraick and his majesty’ hound in full cri after him’ so say he flung his horse’ bridl to a boy and ran up the ascent to the old castl follow by the laird and inde by sever other of the famili alarm by the sound of gun from the sea now distinct heard 
on gain that part of the ruin which command the most extens outlook they saw a lugger with all her canvass crowd stand across the bay close pursu by a sloop of war that kept fire upon the chase from her bow which the lugger return with her sternchas 
‘they’r but at long bowl yet’ cri kennedi in great exult ‘but they will be closer by and by 
dn him he’ start his cargo 
i see the good nantz pitch overboard keg after keg 
that’ a dd ungenteel thing of mr hatteraick as i shall let him know by and by 
now now 
they’v got the wind of him 
that’ it that’ it 
hark to him 
hark to him 
now my dog 
now my dog 
hark to ranger hark’ ‘i think’ said the old garden to one of the maid ‘the ganger’ fie’ by which word the common peopl express those violent spirit which they think a presag of death 
meantim the chase continu 
the lugger be pilot with great abil and use everi nautic shift to make her escap had now reach and was about to doubl the headland which form the extrem point of land on the left side of the bay when a ball have hit the yard in the sling the mainsail fell upon the deck 
the consequ of this accid appear inevit but could not be seen by the spectat for the vessel which had just doubl the headland lost steerag and fell out of their sight behind the promontori 
the sloop of war crowd all sail to pursu but she had stood too close upon the cape so that they were oblig to wear the vessel for fear of go ashor and to make a larg tack back into the bay in order to recov searoom enough to doubl the headland 
‘they ‘ll lose her by cargo and lugger one or both’ said kennedi ‘i must gallop away to the point of warroch this was the headland so often mention and make them a signal where she has drift to on the other side 
goodby for an hour ellangowan get out the gallon punchbowl and plenti of lemon 
i’ll stand for the french articl by the time i come back and we’ll drink the young laird’ health in a bowl that would swim the collector’ yawl’ so say he mount his hors and gallop off 
about a mile from the hous and upon the verg of the wood which as we have said cover a promontori termin in the cape call the point of warroch kennedi met young harri bertram attend by his tutor domini sampson 
he had often promis the child a ride upon his galloway and from sing danc and play punch for his amus was a particular favourit 
he no sooner came scamper up the path than the boy loud claim his promis and kennedi who saw no risk in indulg him and wish to teas the domini in whose visag he read a remonstr caught up harri from the ground place him befor him and continu his rout sampson’ ‘peradventur master kennedy’ be lost in the clatter of his horse’ feet 
the pedagogu hesit a moment whether he should go after them but kennedi be a person in full confid of the famili and with whom he himself had no delight in associ ‘be that he was addict unto profan and scurril jests’ he continu his own walk at his own pace till he reach the place of ellangowan 
the spectat from the ruin wall of the castl were still watch the sloop of war which at length but not without the loss of consider time recov searoom enough to weather the point of warroch and was lost to their sight behind that wood promontori 
some time afterward the discharg of sever cannon were heard at a distanc and after an interv a still louder explos as of a vessel blown up and a cloud of smoke rose abov the tree and mingl with the blue sky 
all then separ on their differ occas augur various upon the fate of the smuggler but the major insist that her captur was inevit if she had not alreadi gone to the bottom 
‘it is near our dinnertim my dear’ said mrs bertram to her husband ‘will it be lang befor mr kennedi come back’ ‘i expect him everi moment my dear’ said the laird ‘perhap he is bring some of the offic of the sloop with him’ ‘mi star mr bertram 
whi did not ye tell me this befor that we might have had the larg round tabl 
and then they’r a’ tire o’ saut meat and to tell you the plain truth a rump o’ beef is the best part of your dinner 
and then i wad have put on anoth gown and ye wadna have been the waur o’ a clean neckcloth yoursel 
but ye delight in surpris and hurri one 
i am sure i am no to baud out for ever against this sort of go on but when folk’ miss then they are moaned’ ‘pshaw pshaw 
deuc take the beef and the gown and tabl and the neckcloth 
we shall do all veri well 
where’ the domini john 
to a servant who was busi about the tabl where’ the domini and littl harry’ ‘mr 
sampson’ been at hame these twa hour and mair but i dinna think mr harri cam hame wi’ him’ ‘not come hame wi’ him’ said the ladi ‘desir mr sampson to step this way directly’ ‘mr 
sampson’ said she upon his entranc ‘is it not the most extraordinari thing in this world wide that you that have free upputtingb board and washingand twelv pound sterl a year just to look after that boy should let him out of your sight for twa or three hours’ sampson made a bow of humbl acknowledg at each paus which the angri ladi made in her enumer of the advantag of his situat in order to give more weight to her remonstr and then in word which we will not do him the injustic to imit told how mr franci kennedi ‘had assum spontan the charg of master harri in despit of his remonstr in the contrary’ ‘i am veri littl oblig to mr franci kennedi for his pains’ said the ladi peevish ‘suppos he let the boy drop from his hors and lame him 
or suppos one of the cannon come ashor and kill him 
or suppose’ ‘or suppos my dear’ said ellangowan ‘what is much more like than anyth els that they have gone aboard the sloop or the prize and are to come round the point with the tide’ ‘and then they may be drowned’ said the ladi 
‘verily’ said sampson ‘i thought mr kennedi had return an hour sinc 
of a sureti i deem i heard his horse’ feet’ ‘that’ said john with a broad grin ‘was grizzel chase the humblecow out of the close’ sampson colour up to the eye not at the impli taunt which he would never have discov or resent if he had but at some idea which cross his own mind 
‘i have been in an error’ he said ‘of a sureti i should have tarri for the babe’ so say he snatch his bonehead cane and hat and hurri away toward warroch wood faster than he was ever known to walk befor or after 
the laird linger some time debat the point with the ladi 
at length he saw the sloop of war again make her appear but without approach the shore she stood away to the westward with all her sail set and was soon out of sight 
the lady’ state of timor and fret apprehens was so habitu that her fear went for noth with her lord and master but an appear of disturb and anxieti among the servant now excit his alarm especi when he was call out of the room and told in privat that mr kennedy’ hors had come to the stabl door alon with the saddl turn round below it belli and the rein of the bridl broken and that a farmer had inform them in pass that there was a smuggl lugger burn like a furnac on the other side of the point of warroch and that though he had come through the wood he had seen or heard noth of kennedi or the young laird ‘on there was domini sampson gaun rampaug about like mad seek for them’ all was now bustl at ellangowan 
the laird and his servant male and femal hasten to the wood of warroch 
the tenant and cottag in the neighbourhood lent their assist part out of zeal part from curios 
boat were man to search the seashor which on the other side of the point rose into high and indent rock 
a vagu suspicion was entertain though too horribl to be express that the child might have fallen from one of these cliff 
the even had begun to close when the parti enter the wood and dispers differ way in quest of the boy and his companion 
the darken of the atmospher and the hoars sigh of the novemb wind through the nake tree the rustl of the wither leav which strew the glade the repeat halloo of the differ parti which often drew them togeth in expect of meet the object of their search gave a cast of dismal sublim to the scene 
at length after a minut and fruitless investig through the wood the searcher began to draw togeth into one bodi and to compar note 
the agoni of the father grew beyond conceal yet it scarc equal the anguish of the tutor 
‘would to god i had die for him’ the affection creatur repeat in note of the deepest distress 
those who were less interest rush into a tumultuari discuss of chanc and possibl 
each gave his opinion and each was altern sway by that of the other 
some thought the object of their search had gone aboard the sloop some that they had gone to a villag at three miles’ distanc some whisper they might have been on board the lugger a few plank and beam of which the tide now drift ashor 
at this instant a shout was heard from the beach so loud so shrill so pierc so differ from everi sound which the wood that day had rung to that nobodi hesit a moment to believ that it convey tide and tide of dread import 
all hurri to the place and ventur without scrupl upon path which at anoth time they would have shudder to look at descend toward a cleft of the rock where one boat’ crew was alreadi land 
‘here sir here 
this way for god’ sake 
this way 
this way’ was the reiter cri 
ellangowan broke through the throng which had alreadi assembl at the fatal spot and beheld the object of their terror 
it was the dead bodi of kennedi 
at first sight he seem to have perish by a fall from the rock which rose abov the spot on which he lay in a perpendicular precipic of a hundr feet abov the beach 
the corps was lie half in half out of the water the advanc tide rais the arm and stir the cloth had given it at some distanc the appear of motion so that those who first discov the bodi thought that life remain 
but everi spark had been long extinguish 
‘mi bairn 
my bairn’ cri the distract father ‘where can he be’ a dozen mouth were open to communic hope which no one felt 
some one at length mentionedth gipsi 
in a moment ellangowan had reascend the cliff flung himself upon the first hors he met and rode furious to the hut at derncleugh 
all was there dark and desol and as he dismount to make more minut search he stumbl over fragment of furnitur which had been thrown out of the cottag and the broken wood and thatch which had been pull down by his order 
at that moment the propheci or anathema of meg merrili fell heavi on his mind 
‘you have strip the thatch from seven cottag see that the rooftre of your own hous stand the surer’ chapter x but see his face is black and full of blood his eyebal farther out than when he live stare full ghast like a strangl man his hair uprear’d his nostril stretch d with struggl his hand abroad display’d as one that grasp’d and tugg’d for life and was by strength subdu henri vi part ii the sheriffdeput of the counti arriv at ellangowan next morn by daybreak 
to this provinci magistr the law of scotland assign judici power of consider extent and the task of inquir into all crime commit within his jurisdict the apprehens and commit of suspect person and so forth 
footnot the scottish sheriff discharg on such occas as that now mention pretti much the same duti as a coron 
the gentleman who held the offic in the shire ofat the time of this catastroph was well born and well educ and though somewhat pedant and profession in his habit he enjoy general respect as an activ and intellig magistr 
his first employ was to examin all wit whose evid could throw light upon this mysteri event and make up the written report proce verbal or precognit as it is technic call which the practic of scotland has substitut for a coroner’ inquest 
under the sheriff’ minut and skil inquiri mani circumst appear which seem incompat with the origin opinion that kennedi had accident fallen from the cliff 
we shall briefli detail some of these 
the bodi had been deposit in a neighbour fisherhut but without alter the condit in which it was found 
this was the first object of the sheriff’ examin 
though fear crush and mangl by the fall from such a height the corps was found to exhibit a deep cut in the head which in the opinion of a skil surgeon must have been inflict by a broadsword or cutlass 
the experi of this gentleman discov other suspici indic 
the face was much blacken the eye distort and the vein of the neck swell 
a colour handkerchief which the unfortun man had worn round his neck did not present the usual appear but was much loosen and the knot displac and drag extrem tight the fold were also compress as if it had been use as a mean of grappl the deceas and drag him perhap to the precipic 
on the other hand poor kennedy’ purs was found untouch and what seem yet more extraordinari the pistol which he usual carri when about to encount ani hazard adventur were found in his pocket load 
this appear particular strang for he was known and dread by the contraband trader as a man equal fearless and dexter in the use of his weapon of which he had given mani signal proof 
the sheriff inquir whether kennedi was not in the practic of carri ani other arm 
most of mr bertram’ servant recollect that he general had a couteau de chass or short hanger but none such was found upon the dead bodi nor could those who had seen him on the morn of the fatal day take it upon them to assert whether he then carri that weapon or not 
the corps afford no other indicia respect the fate of kennedi for though the cloth were much displac and the limb dread fractur the one seem the probabl the other the certain consequ of such a fall 
the hand of the deceas were clench fast and full of turf and earth but this also seem equivoc 
the magistr then proceed to the place where the corps was first discov and made those who had found it give upon the spot a particular and detail account of the manner in which it was lie 
a larg fragment of the rock appear to have accompani or follow the fall of the victim from the cliff abov 
it was of so solid and compact a substanc that it had fallen without ani great diminut by splinter so that the sheriff was enabl first to estim the weight by measur and then to calcul from the appear of the fragment what portion of it had been bed into the cliff from which it had descend 
this was easili detect by the raw appear of the stone where it had not been expos to the atmospher 
they then ascend the cliff and survey the place from whenc the stoni fragment had fallen 
it seem plain from the appear of the bed that the mere weight of one man stand upon the project part of the fragment suppos it in it origin situat could not have destroy it balanc and precipit it with himself from the cliff 
at the same time it appear to have lain so loos that the use of a lever or the combin strength of three or four men might easili have hurl it from it posit 
the short turf about the brink of the precipic was much trampl as if stamp by the heel of men in a mortal struggl or in the act of some violent exert 
trace of the same kind less visibl mark guid the sagaci investig to the verg of the copsewood which in that place crept high up the bank toward the top of the precipic 
with patienc and persever they trace these mark into the thickest part of the cops a rout which no person would have voluntarili adopt unless for the purpos of conceal 
here they found plain vestig of violenc and struggl from space to space 
small bough were torn down as if grasp by some resist wretch who was drag forcibl along the ground where in the least degre soft or marshi show the print of mani feet there were vestig also which might be those of human blood 
at ani rate it was certain that sever person must have forc their passag among the oak hazel and underwood with which they were mingl and in some place appear trace as if a sack full of grain a dead bodi or someth of that heavi and solid descript had been drag along the ground 
in one part of the thicket there was a small swamp the clay of which was whitish be probabl mix with marl 
the back of kennedy’ coat appear besmear with stain of the same colour 
at length about a quarter of a mile from the brink of the fatal precipic the trace conduct them to a small open space of ground veri much trampl and plain stain with blood although wither leav had been strew upon the spot and other mean hastili taken to effac the mark which seem obvious to have been deriv from a desper affray 
on one side of this patch of open ground was found the sufferer’ nake hanger which seem to have been thrown into the thicket on the other the belt and sheath which appear to have been hidden with more leisur care and precaut 
the magistr caus the footprint which mark this spot to be care measur and examin 
some correspond to the foot of the unhappi victim some were larger some less indic that at least four or five men had been busi around him 
abov all here and here onli were observ the vestig of a child’ foot and as it could be seen nowher els and the hard horsetrack which travers the wood of warroch was contigu to the spot it was natur to think that the boy might have escap in that direct dure the confus 
but as he was never heard of the sheriff who made a care entri of all these memoranda did not suppress his opinion that the deceas had met with foul play and that the murder whoever they were had possess themselv of the person of the child harri bertram 
everi exert was now made to discov the crimin 
suspicion hesit between the smuggler and the gipsi 
the fate of dirk hatteraick’ vessel was certain 
two men from the opposit side of warroch bay so the inlet on the southern side of the point of warroch is call had seen though at a great distanc the lugger drive eastward after doubl the headland and as they judg from her manoeuvr in a disabl state 
short after they perceiv that she ground smoke and final took fire 
she was as one of them express himself ‘in a light low’ bright flame when they observ a king’ ship with her colour up heav in sight from behind the cape 
the gun of the burn vessel discharg themselv as the fire reach them and they saw her at length blow up with a great explos 
the sloop of war kept aloof for her own safeti and after hover till the other explod stood away southward under a press of sail 
the sheriff anxious interrog these men whether ani boat had left the vessel 
they could not say they had seen none but they might have put off in such a direct as place the burn vessel and the thick smoke which float landward from it between their cours and the witnesses’ observ 
that the ship destroy was dirk hatteraick’ no one doubt 
his lugger was well known on the coast and had been expect just at this time 
a letter from the command of the king’ sloop to whom the sheriff made applic put the matter beyond doubt he sent also an extract from his logbook of the transact of the day which intim their be on the outlook for a smuggl lugger dirk hatteraick master upon the inform and requisit of franci kennedi of his majesty’ excis servic and that kennedi was to be upon the outlook on the shore in case hatteraick who was known to be a desper fellow and had been repeat outlaw should attempt to run his sloop aground 
about nine o’clock am they discov a sail which answer the descript of hatteraick’ vessel chase her and after repeat signal to her to show colour and bringto fire upon her 
the chase then show hamburgh colour and return the fire and a run fight was maintain for three hour when just as the lugger was doubl the point of warroch they observ that the mainyard was shot in the sling and that the vessel was disabl 
it was not in the power of the manofwar’ men for some time to profit by this circumst owe to their have kept too much in shore for doubl the headland 
after two tack they accomplish this and observ the chase on fire and appar desert 
the fire have reach some cask of spirit which were place on the deck with other combust probabl on purpos burnt with such furi that no boat durst approach the vessel especi as her shot gun were discharg one after anoth by the heat 
the captain had no doubt whatev that the crew had set the vessel on fire and escap in their boat 
after watch the conflagr till the ship blew up his majesty’ sloop the shark stood toward the isl of man with the purpos of intercept the retreat of the smuggler who though they might conceal themselv in the wood for a day or two would probabl take the first opportun of endeavour to make for this asylum 
but they never saw more of them than is abov narrat 
such was the account given by william pritchard master and command of his majesty’ sloop of war shark who conclud by regret deepli that he had not had the happi to fall in with the scoundrel who had had the impud to fire on his majesty’ flag and with an assur that should he meet mr dirk hatteraick in ani futur cruis he would not fail to bring him into port under his stern to answer whatev might be alleg against him

here stood a ruffian with a horrid face lord it o’er a pile of massi plate tumbl into a heap for public sale there was anoth make villain jest at thi undo he had ta’en possess of all thi ancient most domest ornament 
otway 
earli next morn manner mount his hors and accompani by his servant took the road to ellangowan 
he had no need to inquir the way 
a sale in the countri is a place of public resort and amus and peopl of various descript stream to it from all quarter 
after a pleasant ride of about an hour the old tower of the ruin present themselv in the landscap 
the thought with what differ feel he had lost sight of them so mani year befor throng upon the mind of the travel 
the landscap was the same but how chang the feel hope and view of the spectat 
then life and love were new and all the prospect was gild by their ray 
and now disappoint in affect sate with fame and what the world call success his mind goad by bitter and repent recollect his best hope was to find a retir in which he might nurs the melancholi that was to accompani him to his grave 
‘yet whi should an individu mourn over the instabl of his hope and the vaniti of his prospect 
the ancient chief who erect these enorm and massiv tower to be the fortress of their race and the seat of their powercould they have dream the day was to come when the last of their descend should be expel a ruin wander from his possess 
but nature’ bounti are unalt 
the sun will shine as fair on these ruin whether the properti of a stranger or of a sordid and obscur trickster of the abus law as when the banner of the founder first wave upon their battlements’ these reflect brought manner to the door of the hous which was that day open to all 
he enter among other who travers the apart some to select articl for purchas other to gratifi their curios 
there is someth melancholi in such a scene even under the most favour circumst 
the confus state of the furnitur displac for the conveni of be easili view and carri off by the purchas is disagre to the eye 
those articl which proper and decent arrang look credit and handsom have then a paltri and wretch appear and the apart strip of all that render them commodi and comfort have an aspect of ruin and dilapid 
it is disgust also to see the scene of domest societi and seclus thrown open to the gaze of the curious and the vulgar to hear their coars specul and brutal jest upon the fashion and furnitur to which they are unaccustomeda frolicsom humour much cherish by the whiski which in scotland is alway put in circul on such occas 
all these are ordinari effect of such a scene as ellangowan now present but the moral feel that in this case they indic the total ruin of an ancient and honour famili gave them trebl weight and poignanc 
it was some time befor colonel manner could find ani one dispos to answer his reiter question concern ellangowan himself 
at length an old maidserv who held her apron to her eye as she spoke told him ‘the laird was someth better and they hope he would be abl to leav the hous that day 
miss luci expect the chais everi moment and as the day was fine for the time o’year they had carri him in his easychair up to the green befor the auld castl to be out of the way of this unco spectacle’ thither colonel manner went in quest of him and soon came in sight of the littl group which consist of four person 
the ascent was steep so that he had time to reconnoitr them as he advanc and to consid in what mode he should make his address 
mr bertram paralyt and almost incap of move occupi his easychair attir in his nightcap and a loos camlet coat his feet wrap in blanket 
behind him with his hand cross on the cane upon which he rest stood domini sampson whom manner recognis at onc 
time had made no chang upon him unless that his black coat seem more brown and his gaunt cheek more lank than when manner last saw him 
on one side of the old man was a sylphlik forma young woman of about seventeen whom the colonel account to be his daughter 
she was look from time to time anxious toward the avenu as if expect the postchais and between while busi herself in adjust the blanket so as to protect her father from the cold and in answer inquiri which he seem to make with a captious and querul manner 
she did not trust herself to look toward the place although the hum of the assembl crowd must have drawn her attent in that direct 
the fourth person of the group was a handsom and genteel young man who seem to share miss bertram’ anxieti and her solicitud to sooth and accommod her parent 
this young man was the first who observ colonel manner and immedi step forward to meet him as if polit to prevent his draw nearer to the distress group 
manner instant paus and explain 
‘he was’ he said ‘a stranger to whom mr bertram had former shown kind and hospit he would not have intrud himself upon him at a period of distress did it not seem to be in some degre a moment also of desert he wish mere to offer such servic as might be in his power to mr bertram and the young lady’ he then paus at a littl distanc from the chair 
his old acquaint gaze at him with lacklustr eye that intim no token of recognit the domini seem too deepli sunk in distress even to observ his presenc 
the young man spoke asid with miss bertram who advanc timid and thank colonel manner for his good ‘but’ she said the tear gush fast into her eye ‘her father she fear was not so much himself as to be abl to rememb him’ she then retreat toward the chair accompani by the colonel 
‘father’ she said ‘this is mr manner an old friend come to inquir after you’ ‘he’ veri heartili welcome’ said the old man rais himself in his chair and attempt a gestur of courtesi while a gleam of hospit satisfact seem to pass over his fade featur ‘but luci my dear let us go down to the hous you should not keep the gentleman here in the cold 
domini take the key of the winecool 
mr aath gentleman will sure take someth after his ride’ manner was unspeak affect by the contrast which his recollect made between this recept and that with which he had been greet by the same individu when they last met 
he could not restrain his tear and his evid emot at onc attain him the confid of the friendless young ladi 
‘alas’ she said ‘this is distress even to a stranger but it may be better for my poor father to be in this way than if he knew and could feel all’ a servant in liveri now came up the path and spoke in an underton to the young gentleman’mr 
charl my lady’ want you yonder sad to bid for her for the black eboni cabinet and ladi jean devorgoil is wi’ her an’ a’ ye maun come away directly’ ‘tell them you could not find me tom or staysay i am look at the horses’ ‘no no no’ said luci bertram earnest ‘if you would not add to the miseri of this miser moment go to the compani direct 
this gentleman i am sure will see us to the carriage’ ‘unquestion madam’ said manner ‘your young friend may reli on my attention’ ‘farewel then’ said young hazlewood and whisper a word in her ear then ran down the steep hastili as if not trust his resolut at a slower pace 
‘where’ charl hazlewood running’ said the invalid who appar was accustom to his presenc and attent ‘where’ charl hazlewood run 
what take him away now’ ‘he’ll return in a littl while’ said luci gentl 
the sound of voic was now heard from the ruin 
the reader may rememb there was a communic between the castl and the beach up which the speaker had ascend 
‘ye there’ a plenti of shell and seawar for manur as you observ and if one inclin to build a new hous which might inde be necessari there’ a great deal of good hewn stone about this old dungeon for the devil here’ ‘good god’ said miss bertram hastili to sampson ‘‘t is that wretch glossin’ voic 
if my father see him it will kill him outright’ sampson wheel perpendicular round and move with long stride to confront the attorney as he issu from beneath the portal arch of the ruin 
‘avoid ye’ he said ‘avoid ye 
wouldst thou kill and take possession’ ‘come come master domini sampson’ answer glossin insol ‘if ye cannot preach in the pulpit we’ll have no preach here 
we go by the law my good friend we leav the gospel to you’ the veri mention of this man’ name had been of late a subject of the most violent irrit to the unfortun patient 
the sound of his voic now produc an instantan effect 
mr bertram start up without assist and turn round toward him the ghastli of his featur form a strang contrast with the violenc of his exclamations’out of my sight ye viper 
ye frozen viper that i warm till ye stung me 
art thou not afraid that the wall of my father’ dwell should fall and crush thee limb and bone

were ye not friendless houseless penniless when i took ye by the hand and are ye not expel meme and that innoc girlfriendless houseless and penniless from the hous that has shelter us and our for a thousand years’ had glossin been alon he would probabl have slunk off but the conscious that a stranger was present besid the person who came with him a sort of landsurveyor determin him to resort to impud 
the task howev was almost too hard even for his effrontery’sirsirmr bertram sir you should not blame me but your own imprud sir’ chapter xiv the bell strike one

the crowd of assembl gazer and idler at ellangowan had follow the view of amus or what they call busi which brought them there with littl regard to the feel of those who were suffer upon that occas 
few inde knew anyth of the famili 
the father betwixt seclus misfortun and imbecil had drift as it were for mani year out of the notic of his contemporari the daughter had never been known to them 
but when the general murmur announc that the unfortun mr bertram had broken his heart in the effort to leav the mansion of his forefath there pour forth a torrent of sympathi like the water from the rock when stricken by the wand of the prophet 
the ancient descent and unblemish integr of the famili were respect rememb abov all the sacr vener due to misfortun which in scotland seldom demand it tribut in vain then claim and receiv it 
mr macmorlan hastili announc that he would suspend all farther proceed in the sale of the estat and other properti and relinquish the possess of the premis to the young ladi until she could consult with her friend and provid for the burial of her father 
glossin had cower for a few minut under the general express of sympathi till harden by observ that no appear of popular indign was direct his way he had the audac to requir that the sale should proceed 
‘i will take it upon my own author to adjourn it’ said the sheriffsubstitut ‘and will be respons for the consequ 
i will also give due notic when it is again to go forward 
it is for the benefit of all concern that the land should bring the highest price the state of the market will admit and this is sure no time to expect it 
i will take the respons upon myself’ glossin left the room and the hous too with secreci and despatch and it was probabl well for him that he did so sinc our friend jock jabo was alreadi harangu a numer tribe of bareleg boy on the proprieti of pelt him off the estat 
some of the room were hastili put in order for the recept of the young ladi and of her father’ dead bodi 
manner now found his farther interfer would be unnecessari and might be misconstru 
he observ too that sever famili connect with that of ellangowan and who inde deriv their princip claim of gentil from the allianc were now dispos to pay to their tree of genealog a tribut which the advers of their suppos relat had been inadequ to call forth and that the honour of superintend the funer rite of the dead godfrey bertram as in the memor case of homer’ birthplac was like to be debat by seven gentlemen of rank and fortun none of whom had offer him an asylum while live 
he therefor resolv as his presenc was altogeth useless to make a short tour of a fortnight at the end of which period the adjourn sale of the estat of ellangowan was to proceed 
but befor he depart he solicit an interview with the domini 
the poor man appear on be inform a gentleman want to speak to him with some express of surpris in his gaunt featur to which recent sorrow had given an express yet more grisli 
he made two or three profound rever to manner and then stand erect patient wait an explan of his command 
‘you are probabl at a loss to guess mr sampson’ said manner ‘what a stranger may have to say to you’ ‘unless it were to request that i would undertak to train up some youth in polit letter and human learn but i cannoti cannot i have yet a task to perform’ ‘no mr sampson my wish are not so ambiti 
i have no son and my onli daughter i presum you would not consid as a fit pupil’ ‘of a sureti no’ repli the simplemind sampson 
‘nathless it was i who did educ miss luci in all use learn albeit it was the housekeep who did teach her those unprofit exercis of hem and shaping’ ‘well sir’ repli manner ‘it is of miss luci i meant to speak 
you have i presum no recollect of me’ sampson alway suffici absent in mind neither rememb the astrolog of past year nor even the stranger who had taken his patron’ part against glossin so much had his friend’ sudden death embroil his idea 
‘well that doe not signify’ pursu the colonel ‘i am an old acquaint of the late mr bertram abl and will to assist his daughter in her present circumst 
besid i have thought of make this purchas and i should wish thing kept in order about the place will you have the good to appli this small sum in the usual famili expenses’ he put into the dominie’ hand a purs contain some gold 
‘prodigious’ exclaim domini sampson 
‘but if your honour would tarry’ ‘imposs sir impossible’ said manner make his escap from him 
‘prodigious’ again exclaim sampson follow to the head of the stair still hold out the purs 
‘but as touch this coin money’ manner escap downstair as fast as possibl 
‘prodigious’ exclaim domini sampson yet the third time now stand at the front door 
‘but as touch this specie’ but manner was now on horseback and out of hear 
the domini who had never either in his own right or as truste for anoth been possess of a quarter part of this sum though it was not abov twenti guinea ‘took counsel’ as he express himself ‘how he should demean himself with respect unto the fine gold’ thus left in his charg 
fortun he found a disinterest advis in macmorlan who point out the most proper mean of dispos of it for contribut to miss bertram’ conveni be no doubt the purpos to which it was destin by the bestow 
mani of the neighbour gentri were now sincer eager in press offer of hospit and kind upon miss bertram 
but she felt a natur reluct to enter ani famili for the first time as an object rather of benevol than hospit and determin to wait the opinion and advic of her father’ nearest femal relat mrs margaret bertram of singlesid an old unmarri ladi to whom she wrote an account of her present distress situat 
the funer of the late mr bertram was perform with decent privaci and the unfortun young ladi was now to consid herself as but the temporari tenant of the hous in which she had been born and where her patienc and sooth attent had so long ‘rock the cradl of declin age’ her communic with mr macmorlan encourag her to hope that she would not be sudden or unkind depriv of this asylum but fortun had order otherwis 
for two day befor the appoint day for the sale of the land and estat of ellangowan macmorlan daili expect the appear of colonel manner or at least a letter contain power to act for him 
but none such arriv 
mr macmorlan wake earli in the morn walk over to the postofficether were no letter for him 
he endeavour to persuad himself that he should see colonel manner to breakfast and order his wife to place her best china and prepar herself accord 
but the prepar were in vain 
‘could i have foreseen this’ he said ‘i would have travel scotland over but i would have found some one to bid against glossin’ ala 
such reflect were all too late 
the appoint hour arriv and the parti met in the masons’ lodg at kippletringan be the place fix for the adjourn sale 
macmorlan spent as much time in preliminari as decenc would permit and read over the articl of sale as slowli as if he had been read his own deathwarr 
he turn his eye everi time the door of the room open with hope which grew fainter and fainter 
he listen to everi nois in the street of the villag and endeavour to distinguish in it the sound of hoof or wheel 
it was all in vain 
a bright idea then occur that colonel manner might have employ some other person in the transact he would not have wast a moment’ thought upon the want of confid in himself which such a manoeuvr would have evinc 
but this hope also was groundless 
after a solemn paus mr glossin offer the upset price for the land and baroni of ellangowan 
no repli was made and no competitor appear so after a laps of the usual interv by the run of a sandglass upon the intend purchas enter the proper sureti mr macmorlan was oblig in technic term to ‘find and declar the sale law complet and to prefer the said gilbert glossin as the purchas of the said land and estate’ the honest writer refus to partak of a splendid entertain with which gilbert glossin esquir now of ellangowan treat the rest of the compani and return home in huge bitter of spirit which he vent in complaint against the fickl and capric of these indian nabob who never knew what they would be at for ten day togeth 
fortun generous determin to take the blame upon herself and cut off even this vent of macmorlan’ resent 
an express arriv about six o’clock at night ‘veri particular drunk’ the maidserv said with a packet from colonel manner date four day back at a town about a hundr miles’ distanc from kippletringan contain full power to mr macmorlan or ani one whom he might employ to make the intend purchas and state that some famili busi of consequ call the colonel himself to westmoreland where a letter would find him address to the care of arthur mervyn esq of mervyn hall 
macmorlan in the transport of his wrath flung the power of attorney at the head of the innoc maidserv and was onli forcibl withheld from horsewhip the rascal messeng by whose sloth and drunken the disappoint had taken place

i hope i shall often hear from you’ she slid into his hand a paper contain some piec of gold and rose as if to leav the room 
domini sampson also rose but it was to stand aghast with utter astonish 
the idea of part from miss luci go where she might had never onc occur to the simplic of his understand 
he laid the money on the tabl 
‘it is certain inadequate’ said macmorlan mistak his mean ‘but the circumstances’ mr sampson wave his hand impatiently’it is not the lucr it is not the lucr but that i that have ate of her father’ loaf and drank of his cup for twenti year and moreto think that i am go to leav her and to leav her in distress and dolour 
no miss luci you need never think it 
you would not consent to put forth your father’ poor dog and would you use me waur than a messan 
no miss luci bertram while i live i will not separ from you 
i’ll be no burden i have thought how to prevent that 
but as ruth said unto naomi “entreat me not to leav thee nor to depart from thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou dwellest i will dwell thi peopl shall be my peopl and thi god shall be my god 
where thou diest will i die and there will i be buri 
the lord do so to me and more also if aught but death do part thee and me�’ dure this speech the longest ever domini sampson was known to utter the affection creature’ eye stream with tear and neither luci nor macmorlan could refrain from sympathis with this unexpect burst of feel and attach 
‘mr 
sampson’ said macmorlan after have had recours to his snuffbox and handkerchief altern ‘mi hous is larg enough and if you will accept of a bed there while miss bertram honour us with her resid i shall think myself veri happi and my roof much favour by receiv a man of your worth and fidelity’ and then with a delicaci which was meant to remov ani object on miss bertram’ part to bring with her this unexpect satellit he ad ‘mi busi requir my frequent have occas for a better account than ani of my present clerk and i should be glad to have recours to your assist in that way now and then’ ‘of a sureti of a surety’ said sampson eager ‘i understand bookkeep by doubl entri and the italian method’ our postilion had thrust himself into the room to announc his chais and hors he tarri unobserv dure this extraordinari scene and assur mrs maccandlish it was the most move thing he ever saw ‘the death of the grey mare puir hizzi was naeth till’t’ this trifl circumst afterward had consequ of greater moment to the domini 
the visitor were hospit welcom by mrs macmorlan to whom as well as to other her husband intim that he had engag domini sampson’ assist to disentangl some perplex account dure which occup he would for conveni sake resid with the famili 
mr macmorlan’ knowledg of the world induc him to put this colour upon the matter awar that howev honour the fidel of the dominie’ attach might be both to his own heart and to the famili of ellangowan his exterior ill qualifi him to be a’squir of dames’ and render him upon the whole rather a ridicul appendag to a beauti young woman of seventeen 
domini sampson achiev with great zeal such task as mr macmorlan chose to entrust him with but it was speedili observ that at a certain hour after breakfast he regular disappear and return again about dinnertim 
the even he occupi in the labour of the offic 
on saturday he appear befor macmorlan with a look of great triumph and laid on the tabl two piec of gold 
‘what is this for dominie’ said macmorlan 
‘first to indemnifi you of your charg in my behalf worthi sir and the balanc for the use of miss luci bertram’ ‘but mr sampson your labour in the offic much more than recompens me i am your debtor my good friend’ ‘then be it all’ said the domini wave his hand ‘for miss luci bertram’ behoof’ ‘well but domini this money’ ‘it is honest come by mr macmorlan it is the bounti reward of a young gentleman to whom i am teach the tongu read with him three hour daily’ a few more question extract from the domini that this liber pupil was young hazlewood and that he met his preceptor daili at the hous of mrs maccandlish whose proclam of sampson’ disinterest attach to the young ladi had procur him this indefatig and bounteous scholar 
macmorlan was much struck with what he heard 
domini sampson was doubtless a veri good scholar and an excel man and the classic were unquestion veri well worth read yet that a young man of twenti should ride seven mile and back again each day in the week to hold this sort of teteatet of three hour was a zeal for literatur to which he was not prepar to give entir credit 
littl art was necessari to sift the domini for the honest man’ head never admit ani but the most direct and simpl idea 
‘doe miss bertram know how your time is engag my good friend’ ‘sure not as yet 
mr charl recommend it should be conceal from her lest she should scrupl to accept of the small assist aris from it but’ he ad ‘it would not be possibl to conceal it long sinc mr charl propos take his lesson occasion in this house’ ‘o he does’ said macmorlan’ yes yes i can understand that better 
and pray mr sampson are these three hour entir spent inconstru and translating’ ‘doubtless no we have also colloqui intercours to sweeten studi nequ semper arcum tendit apollo’ the querist proceed to elicit from this galloway phoebus what their discours chiefli turn upon 
‘upon our past meet at ellangowan and truli i think veri often we discours concern miss luci for mr charl hazlewood in that particular resembleth me mr macmorlan 
when i begin to speak of her i never know when to stop and as i say jocular she cheat us out of half our lessons’ ‘o ho’ thought macmorlan ‘sit the wind in that quarter 
i’v heard someth like this before’ he then began to consid what conduct was safest for his protege and even for himself for the senior mr hazlewood was power wealthi ambiti and vindict and look for both fortun and titl in ani connexion which his son might form 
at length have the highest opinion of his guest’ good sens and penetr he determin to take an opportun when they should happen to be alon to communic the matter to her as a simpl piec of intellig 
he did so in as natur a manner as he could 
‘i wish you joy of your friend mr sampson’ good fortun miss bertram he has got a pupil who pay him two guinea for twelv lesson of greek and latin’ ‘inde 
i am equal happi and surpris 
who can be so liber 
is colonel manner returned’ ‘no no not colonel manner but what do you think of your acquaint mr charl hazlewood 
he talk of take his lesson here i wish we may have accommod for him’ luci blush deepli 
‘for heaven’ sake no mr macmorlan do not let that be charl hazlewood has had enough of mischief about that already’ ‘about the classic my dear young lady’ wil seem to misunderstand her ‘most young gentlemen have so at one period or anoth sure enough but his present studi are voluntary’ miss bertram let the convers drop and her host made no effort to renew it as she seem to paus upon the intellig in order to form some intern resolut 
the next day miss bertram took an opportun of convers with mr sampson 
express in the kindest manner her grate thank for his disinterest attach and her joy that he had got such a provis she hint to him that his present mode of superintend charl hazlewood’ studi must be so inconveni to his pupil that while that engag last he had better consent to a temporari separ and resid either with his scholar or as near him as might be 
sampson refus as inde she had expect to listen a moment to this proposit he would not quit her to be made preceptor to the princ of wale 
‘but i see’ he ad ‘you are too proud to share my pittanc and peradventur i grow wearisom unto you’ ‘no inde you were my father’ ancient almost his onli friend 
i am not proud god know i have no reason to be so 
you shall do what you judg best in other matter but oblig me by tell mr charl hazlewood that you had some convers with me concern his studi and that i was of opinion that his carri them on in this hous was altogeth impractic and not to be thought of’ domini sampson left her presenc altogeth crestfallen and as he shut the door could not help mutter the ‘varium et mutabile’ of virgil 
next day he appear with a veri rueful visag and tender miss bertram a letter 
‘mr 
hazlewood’ he said ‘was to discontinu his lesson though he had generous made up the pecuniari loss 
but how will he make up the loss to himself of the knowledg he might have acquir under my instruct 
even in that one articl of writingh was an hour befor he could write that brief note and destroy mani scroll four quill and some good white paper 
i would have taught him in three week a firm current clear and legibl hand he should have been a calligrapherbut god’ will be done’ the letter contain but a few line deepli regret and murmur against miss bertram’ cruelti who not onli refus to see him but to permit him in the most indirect manner to hear of her health and contribut to her servic 
but it conclud with assur that her sever was vain and that noth could shake the attach of charl hazlewood 
under the activ patronag of mrs maccandlish sampson pick up some other scholarsveri differ inde from charl hazlewood in rank and whose lesson were proport unproduct 
still howev he gain someth and it was the glori of his heart to carri it to mr macmorlan week a slight peculium onli subtract to suppli his snuffbox and tobaccopouch

he went accord to edinburgh and elsewher and it was in his return toward the southwestern district of scotland in which our scene lie that at a posttown about a hundr mile from kippletringan to which he had request his friend mr mervyn to address his letter he receiv one from that gentleman which contain rather unpleas intellig 
we have assum alreadi the privileg of act a secreti to this gentleman and therefor shall present the reader with an extract from this epistl 
‘i beg your pardon my dearest friend for the pain i have given you in forc you to open wound so fester as those your letter refer to 
i have alway heard though erron perhap that the attent of mr brown were intend for miss manner 
but howev that were it could not be suppos that in your situat his bold should escap notic and chastis 
wise men say that we resign to civil societi our natur right of selfdef onli on condit that the ordin of law should protect us 
where the price cannot be paid the resign becom void 
for instanc no one suppos that i am not entitl to defend my purs and person against a highwayman as much as if i were a wild indian who own neither law nor magistraci 
the question of resist or submiss must be determin by my mean and situat 
but if arm and equal in forc i submit to injustic and violenc from ani man high or low i presum it will hard be attribut to religi or moral feel in me or in ani one but a quaker 
an aggress on my honour seem to me much the same 
the insult howev trifl in itself is one of much deeper consequ to all view in life than ani wrong which can be inflict by a depred on the highway and to redress the injur parti is much less in the power of public jurisprud or rather it is entir beyond it reach 
if ani man choos to rob arthur mervyn of the content of his purs suppos the said arthur has not mean of defenc or the skill and courag to use them the assiz at lancast or carlisl will do him justic by tuck up the robber yet who will say i am bound to wait for this justic and submit to be plunder in the first instanc if i have myself the mean and spirit to protect my own properti 
but if an affront is offer to me submiss under which is to tarnish my charact for ever with men of honour and for which the twelv judg of england with the chancellor to boot can afford me no redress by what rule of law or reason am i to be deter from protect what ought to be and is so infinit dearer to everi man of honour than his whole fortun 
of the religi view of the matter i shall say noth until i find a reverend divin who shall condemn selfdef in the articl of life and properti 
if it proprieti in that case be general admit i suppos littl distinct can be drawn between defenc of person and good and protect of reput 
that the latter is liabl to be assail by person of a differ rank in life untaint perhap in moral and fair in charact cannot affect my legal right of selfdef 
i may be sorri that circumst have engag me in person strife with such an individu but i should feel the same sorrow for a generous enemi who fell under my sword in a nation quarrel 
i shall leav the question with the casuist howev onli observ that what i have written will not avail either the profess duellist or him who is the aggressor in a disput of honour 
i onli presum to exculp him who is drag into the field by such an offenc as submit to in patienc would forfeit for ever his rank and estim in societi 
‘i am sorri you have thought of settl in scotland and yet glad that you will still be at no immeasur distanc and that the latitud is all in our favour

but i must still earn my colleg nicknam of downright dunstabl 
in one word then here is the matter 
‘your daughter has much of the romant turn of your disposit with a littl of that love of admir which all pretti women share less or more 
she will besid appar be your heiress a trifl circumst to those who view julia with my eye but a prevail bait to the specious art and worthless 
you know how i have jest with her about her soft melancholi and lone walk at morn befor ani one is up and in the moonlight when all should be gone to bed or set down to card which is the same thing 
the incid which follow may not be beyond the bound of a joke but i had rather the jest upon it came from you than me 
‘two or three time dure the last fortnight i heard at a late hour in the night or veri earli in the morn a flageolet play the littl hindu tune to which your daughter is so partial 
i thought for some time that some tune domest whose tast for music was laid under constraint dure the day chose that silent hour to imit the strain which he had caught up by the ear dure his attend in the drawingroom 
but last night i sat late in my studi which is immedi under miss mannering’ apart and to my surpris i not onli heard the flageolet distinct but satisfi myself that it came from the lake under the window 
curious to know who serenad us at that unusu hour i stole soft to the window of my apart 
but there were other watcher than me 
you may rememb miss manner prefer that apart on account of a balconi which open from her window upon the lake 
well sir i heard the sash of her window thrown up the shutter open and her own voic in convers with some person who answer from below 
this is not “much ado about nothing� i could not be mistaken in her voic and such tone so soft so insinu and to say the truth the accent from below were in passion’ tenderest cadenc toobut of the sens i can say noth 
i rais the sash of my own window that i might hear someth more than the mere murmur of this spanish rendezv but though i use everi precaut the nois alarm the speaker down slid the young lady’ casement and the shutter were bar in an instant 
the dash of a pair of oar in the water announc the retreat of the male person of the dialogu 
inde i saw his boat which he row with great swift and dexter fli across the lake like a twelveoar barg 
next morn i examin some of my domest as if by accid and i found the gamekeep when make his round had twice seen that boat beneath the hous with a singl person and had heard the flageolet 
i did not care to press ani farther question for fear of implic julia in the opinion of those of whom they might be ask 
next morn at breakfast i drop a casual hint about the serenad of the even befor and i promis you miss manner look red and pale altern 
i immedi gave the circumst such a turn as might lead her to suppos that my observ was mere casual 
i have sinc caus a watchlight to be burnt in my librari and have left the shutter open to deter the approach of our nocturn guest and i have state the sever of approach winter and the raw of the fog as an object to solitari walk 
miss manner acquiesc with a passiv which is no part of her charact and which to tell you the plain truth is a featur about the busi which i like least of all 
julia has too much of her own dear papa’ disposit to be curb in ani of her humour were there not some littl lurk conscious that it may be as prudent to avoid debat 
‘now my stori is told and you will judg what you ought to do 
i have not mention the matter to my good woman who a faith secretari to her sex’ foibl would certain remonstr against your be made acquaint with these particular and might instead take it into her head to exercis her own eloqu on miss manner a faculti which howev power when direct against me it legitim object might i fear do more harm than good in the case suppos

i have resist i have subdu the rebelli feel which aros to aid his plea yet how to extric myself from this unhappi labyrinth in which fate and folli have entangl us both 
‘i have thought upon it matilda till my head is almost giddi nor can i conceiv a better plan than to make a full confess to my father 
he deserv it for his kind is unceas and i think i have observ in his charact sinc i have studi it more near that his harsher feel are chiefli excit where he suspect deceit or imposit and in that respect perhap his charact was former misunderstood by one who was dear to him 
he has too a ting of romanc in his disposit and i have seen the narrat of a generous action a trait of heroism or virtuous selfdeni extract tear from him which refus to flow at a tale of mere distress 
but then brown urg that he is person hostil to him 
and the obscur of his birth that would be inde a stumblingblock 
o matilda i hope none of your ancestor ever fought at poictier or agincourt 
if it were not for the vener which my father attach to the memori of old sir mile manner i should make out my explan with half the tremor which must now attend it’ seventh extract ‘i have this instant receiv your letteryour most welcom letter 
thank my dearest friend for your sympathi and your counsel i can onli repay them with unbound confid 
‘you ask me what brown is by origin that his descent should be so unpleas to my father 
his stori is short told 
he is of scottish extract but be left an orphan his educ was undertaken by a famili of relat settl in holland 
he was bred to commerc and sent veri earli to one of our settlement in the east where his guardian had a correspond 
but this correspond was dead when he arriv in india and he had no other resourc than to offer himself as a clerk to a countinghous 
the break out of the war and the strait to which we were at first reduc threw the armi open to all young men who were dispos to embrac that mode of life and brown whose genius had a strong militari tendenc was the first to leav what might have been the road to wealth and to choos that of fame 
the rest of his histori is well known to you but conceiv the irrit of my father who despis commerc though by the way the best part of his properti was made in that honour profess by my greatuncl and has a particular antipathi to the dutchthink with what ear he would be like to receiv propos for his onli child from vanbeest brown educ for chariti by the hous of vanbeest and vanbruggen 
o matilda it will never do nay so childish am i i hard can help sympathis with his aristocrat feel 
mrs vanbeest brown

i shall never have courag to tell my father nay most deepli do i fear he has alreadi learn my secret from anoth quarter which will entir remov the grace of my communic and ruin whatev gleam of hope i had ventur to connect with it 
yesternight brown came as usual and his flageolet on the lake announc his approach 
we had agre that he should continu to use this signal 
these romant lake attract numer visitor who indulg their enthusiasm in visit the sceneri at all hour and we hope that if brown were notic from the hous he might pass for one of those admir of natur who was give vent to his feel through the medium of music 
the sound might also be my apolog should i be observ on the balconi 
but last night while i was eager enforc my plan of a full confess to my father which he as earnest deprec we heard the window of mr mervyn’ librari which is under my room open soft 
i sign to brown to make his retreat and immedi reenter with some faint hope that our interview had not been observ 
‘but ala 
matilda these hope vanish the instant i beheld mr mervyn’ counten at breakfast the next morn 
he look so provok intellig and confidenti that had i dare i could have been more angri than ever i was in my life but i must be on good behaviour and my walk are now limit within his farm precinct where the good gentleman can ambl along by my side without inconveni 
i have detect him onc or twice attempt to sound my thought and watch the express of my counten 
he has talk of the flageolet more than onc and has at differ time made eulogium upon the watch and feroc of his dog and the regular with which the keeper make his round with a load fowlingpiec 
he mention even mantrap and springgun 
i should be loth to affront my father’ old friend in his own hous but i do long to show him that i am my father’ daughter a fact of which mr mervyn will certain be convinc if ever i trust my voic and temper with a repli to these indirect hint 
of one thing i am certaini am grate to him on that accounth has not told mrs mervyn 
lord help me i should have had such lectur about the danger of love and the night air on the lake the risk aris from cold and fortunehunt the comfort and conveni of sackwhey and close window 
i cannot help trifl matilda though my heart is sad enough 
what brown will do i cannot guess 
i presum howev the fear of detect prevent his resum his nocturn visit 
he lodg at an inn on the opposit shore of the lake under the name he tell me of dawson he has a bad choic in name that must be allow 
he has not left the armi i believ but he say noth of his present view ‘to complet my anxieti my father is return sudden and in high displeasur 
our good hostess as i learn from a bustl convers between her housekeep and her had no expect of see him for a week but i rather suspect his arriv was no surpris to his friend mr mervyn 
his manner to me was singular cold and constrain suffici so to have damp all the courag with which i onc resolv to throw myself on his generos 
he lay the blame of his be discompos and out of humour to the loss of a purchas in the southwest of scotland on which he had set his heart but i do not suspect his equanim of be so easili thrown off it balanc 
his first excurs was with mr mervyn’ barg across the lake to the inn i have mention 
you may imagin the agoni with which i wait his return 
had he recogn brown who can guess the consequ 
he return howev appar without have made ani discoveri 
i understand that in consequ of his late disappoint he mean now to hire a hous in the neighbourhood of this same ellangowan of which i am doom to hear so much he seem to think it probabl that the estat for which he wish may soon be again in the market 
i will not send away this letter until i hear more distinct what are his intentions’ ‘i have now had an interview with my father as confidenti as i presum he mean to allow me 
he request me today after breakfast to walk with him into the librari my knee matilda shook under me and it is no exagger to say i could scarc follow him into the room 
i fear i knew not what 
from my childhood i had seen all around him trembl at his frown 
he motion me to seat myself and i never obey a command so readili for in truth i could hard stand 
he himself continu to walk up and down the room 
you have seen my father and notic i recollect the remark express cast of his featur 
his eye are natur rather light in colour but agit or anger give them a darker and more fieri glanc he has a custom also of draw in his lip when much move which impli a combat between nativ ardour of temper and the habitu power of selfcommand 
this was the first time we had been alon sinc his return from scotland and as he betray these token of agit i had littl doubt that he was about to enter upon the subject i most dread 
chapter xix which slope hill around inclos where mani a beech and brown oak grow beneath whose dark and branch bower it tide a farfam’d river pour by natur beauti taught to pleas sweet tusculan of rural easel warton 
woodbourn the habit which manner by mr macmorlan’ mediat had hire for a season was a larg comfort mansion snug situat beneath a hill cover with wood which shroud the hous upon the north and east the front look upon a littl lawn border by a grove of old tree beyond were some arabl field extend down to the river which was seen from the window of the hous 
a toler though oldfashion garden a wellstock dovecot and the possess of ani quantiti of ground which the conveni of the famili might requir render the place in everi respect suitabl as the advertis have it ‘for the accommod of a genteel family’ here then manner resolv for some time at least to set up the staff of his rest 
though an eastindian he was not partial to an ostentati display of wealth 
in fact he was too proud a man to be a vain one 
he resolv therefor to place himself upon the foot of a countri gentleman of easi fortun without assum or permit his household to assum ani of the fast which then was consid as characterist of a nabob 
he had still his eye upon the purchas of ellangowan which macmorlan conceiv mr glossin would be compel to part with as some of the creditor disput his titl to retain so larg a part of the purchasemoney in his own hand and his power to pay it was much question 
in that case macmorlan was assur he would readili give up his bargain if tempt with someth abov the price which he had stipul to pay 
it may seem strang that manner was so much attach to a spot which he had onli seen onc and that for a short time in earli life 
but the circumst which pass there had laid a strong hold on his imagin 
there seem to be a fate which conjoin the remark passag of his own famili histori with those of the inhabit of ellangowan and he felt a mysteri desir to call the terrac his own from which he had read in the book of heaven a fortun strang accomplish in the person of the infant heir of that famili and correspond so close with one which had been strike fulfil in his own 
besid when onc this thought had got possess of his imagin he could not without great reluct brook the idea of his plan be defeat and by a fellow like glossin 
so pride came to the aid of fanci and both combin to fortifi his resolut to buy the estat if possibl 
let us do manner justic 
a desir to serv the distress had also it share in determin him 
he had consid the advantag which julia might receiv from the compani of luci bertram whose genuin prudenc and good sens could so sure be reli upon 
this idea had becom much stronger sinc macmorlan had confid to him under the solemn seal of secreci the whole of her conduct toward young hazlewood 
to propos to her to becom an inmat in his famili if distant from the scene of her youth and the few whom she call friend would have been less delic but at woodbourn she might without difficulti be induc to becom the visitor of a season without be depress into the situat of an humbl companion 
luci bertram with some hesit accept the invit to resid a few week with miss manner 
she felt too well that howev the colonel’ delicaci might disguis the truth his princip motiv was a generous desir to afford her his counten and protect which his high connexion and higher charact were like to render influenti in the neighbourhood 
about the same time the orphan girl receiv a letter from mrs bertram the relat to whom she had written as cold and comfortless as could well be imagin 
it inclos inde a small sum of money but strong recommend economi and that miss bertram should board herself in some quiet famili either at kippletringan or in the neighbourhood assur her that though her own incom was veri scanti she would not see her kinswoman want 
miss bertram shed some natur tear over this coldheart epistl for in her mother’ time this good ladi had been a guest at ellangowan for near three year and it was onli upon succeed to a properti of about l400 a year that she had taken farewel of that hospit mansion which otherwis might have had the honour of shelter her until the death of it owner 
luci was strong inclin to return the paltri donat which after some struggl with avaric pride had extort from the old ladi 
but on consider she content herself with write that she accept it as a loan which she hope in a short time to repay and consult her relat upon the invit she had receiv from colonel and miss manner 
this time the answer came in cours of post so fear was mrs bertram that some frivol delicaci or nonsens as she term it might induc her cousin to reject such a promis offer and therebi at the same time to leav herself still a burden upon her relat 
luci therefor had no altern unless she prefer continu a burden upon the worthi macmorlan who were too liber to be rich 
those kinsfolk who former request the favour of her compani had of late either silent or with express of resent that she should have prefer macmorlan’ invit to their gradual withdrawn their notic 
the fate of domini sampson would have been deplor had it depend upon ani one except manner who was an admir of origin for a separ from luci bertram would have certain broken his heart 
macmorlan had given a full account of his proceed toward the daughter of his patron 
the answer was a request from manner to know whether the domini still possess that admir virtu of taciturn by which he was so notabl distinguish at ellangowan 
macmorlan repli in the affirm 
‘let mr sampson know’ said the colonel’ next letter ‘that i shall want his assist to catalogu and put in order the librari of my uncl the bishop which i have order to be sent down by sea 
i shall also want him to copi and arrang some paper 
fix his salari at what you think befit 
let the poor man be proper dress and accompani his young ladi to woodbourne’ honest macmorlan receiv this mandat with great joy but ponder much upon execut that part of it which relat to newli attir the worthi domini 
he look at him with a scrutinis eye and it was but too plain that his present garment were daili wax more deplor 
to give him money and bid him go and furnish himself would be onli give him the mean of make himself ridicul for when such a rare event arriv to mr sampson as the purchas of new garment the addit which he made to his wardrob by the guidanc of his own tast usual brought all the boy of the villag after him for mani day 
on the other hand to bring a tailor to measur him and send home his cloth as for a schoolboy would probabl give offenc 
at length macmorlan resolv to consult miss bertram and request her interfer 
she assur him that though she could not pretend to superintend a gentleman’ wardrob noth was more easi than to arrang the dominie’ 
‘at ellangowan’ she said ‘whenev my poor father thought ani part of the dominie’ dress want renew a servant was direct to enter his room by night for he sleep as fast as a dormous carri off the old vestment and leav the new one nor could ani one observ that the domini exhibit the least conscious of the chang put upon him on such occasions’ macmorlan in conform with miss bertram’ advic procur a skil artist who on look at the domini attent undertook to make for him two suit of cloth one black and one ravengrey and even engag that they should fit hima well at least so the tailor qualifi his enterpris as a man of such an outoftheway build could be fit by mere human needl and shear 
when this fashion had accomplish his task and the dress were brought home macmorlan judici resolv to accomplish his purpos by degre withdrew that even an import part of his dress and substitut the new articl of raiment in it stead 
perceiv that this pass total without notic he next ventur on the waistcoat and last on the coat 
when fulli metamorphos and array for the first time in his life in a decent dress they did observ that the domini seem to have some indistinct and embarrass conscious that a chang had taken place on his outward man 
whenev they observ this dubious express gather upon his counten accompani with a glanc that fix now upon the sleev of his coat now upon the knee of his breech where he probabl miss some antiqu patch and darn which be execut with blue thread upon a black ground had somewhat the effect of embroideri they alway took care to turn his attent into some other channel until his garment ‘bi the aid of use cleav to their mould’ the onli remark he was ever known to make on the subject was that ‘the air of a town like kippletringan seem favour unto wear apparel for he thought his coat look almost as new as the first day he put it on which was when he went to stand trial for his licens as a preacher’ when the domini first heard the liber propos of colonel manner he turn a jealous and doubt glanc toward miss bertram as if he suspect that the project involv their separ but when mr macmorlan hasten to explain that she would be a guest at woodbourn for some time he rub his huge hand togeth and burst into a portent sort of chuckl like that of the afrit in the tale of ‘the caliph vathek’ after this unusu explos of satisfact he remain quit passiv in all the rest of the transact

make use mascot 191 3 thing that bring you good luck and bad luck ask a dozen peopl whether they have ani superstit and the major will tell you without hesit that they have not the slightest belief in such thing 
if the truth is told there are veri few of us who do not cherish some littl weak in this direct 
one person may believ in a number of superstit anoth has perhap onli a few that are observ but he or she that has none at all is a remark rare individu 
as a matter of fact most superstit are base on reason and sound common sens and the man or woman who pay heed to them is act intellig whether he or she know it or not 
take for instanc the belief that it is unlucki to walk under a ladder 
true the old assert is that it is unlucki to do so becaus jesus christ was taken down from the cross by mean of a ladder 
but the more practic reason is that painter and other men on ladder are veri like to drop thing and if you happen to be pass at the time the paintpot or the tool will fall on you 
of cours the reason for all superstit are not so evid as this one about walk under a ladder nevertheless there is a germ of reason in them all whether or not we know the reason 
thus the man or woman who observ the common superstit of everyday life is act wise 
not onli will he or she avoid a good deal of troubl but his action will provid him with a sens of wellb and the effect it will have on his mind the psycholog effect as it is call is all to the good 
it is not propos to explain whi this or that superstit is worthi of be observ in mani case the reason is obscur but here we will give some of the belief which are current at the present time 
first of all you should never pass anybodi on the stair of a privat hous and while talk of stair it may be said that mani peopl believ that for someon to fall up a step is a sign of an approach wed 
never light three cigarett with the same match unless you are prepar for a spell of illfortun 
this superstit gain currenc dure the war probabl becaus a match held long enough to light three cigarett would give the enemi a clue to your posit especi at nighttim 
if the cord of a pictur frame snap and the pictur fall to the ground it is an omen that somebodi is go to die 
if the pictur is a portrait of a live person then that person life is the one like to be termin 
this omen may be consid a remark silli one with not a shred of sens to recommend it 
yet how mani peopl can point to instanc when the propheci has come true 
of salt there are sever omen 
the chief one tell you not to help anybodi to salt in other word it is unwis to put some on a person plate 
help them to salt is help them to sorrow 
anoth superstit says4 that if you spill salt you will be unlucki unless you throw a pinch of it over your left shoulder 
to break a mirror is known by all as a serious matter 
the reason whi it is unlucki we are told doubtless find it origin in a mere associ of idea 
the mirror be broken the imag of the person look into it is destroy therefor bad luck in some form must be the fate of the careless one 
what exact is the penalti one must pay for break a mirror is not definit 
some peopl speak of seven year of misfortun while other claim that it mean seven year of celibaci 
to take certain thing into the hous is the height of folli if you believ in superstit 
may or hawthorn blossom is one though the berri of this flower seem to have no illpot 
peacock feather are anoth 
somewhat similar is the content that it is veri unlucki to open an umbrella indoor 
while sit at the mealtabl there are sever thing that must not be done 
help a friend to salt has been alreadi mention but you must not allow the knive or fork to becom cross 
quarrel with your friend will result if you do 
of cours you must not sit down thirteen of you around the tabl 
as is well known this belief has it origin in the last supper when our lord sat at meat with his twelv apostl 
on the other hand should you tast a fruit for the first time in that season you have onli to frame a wish and it will be grant 
much the same appli to mincepi 
you will be award with a whole happi month for each pie that you eat at christmastim which is made in a differ hous 
of cours it is high unwis for two peopl to pour tea out of the same pot at the same meal 
to give a friend an edg tool is sure to cut the friendship whether it be a knife a pair of scissor a razor or a chisel 
when such a gift is to be made the usual plan is to sell it to your friend for a penni 
you should never put a shoe on a tabl and to see a pin lie on the floor and leav it there is an omen that you will want befor you die 
as the jingl run see a pin and let it lie your sure to want befor you die 
see a pin and pick it up then your sure to have good luck 
elsewher a good deal is said about dream 
here it will be suffici to mention one or two item of interest 
it is decid unlucki to dream of a babi yet to dream of a funer is lucki 
the follow is worth bear in mind friday dream and saturday told sure to come true if ever so old 
and here it will be appropri to recal the fact that it is an unwis thing to get out of bed on the wrong side 
the devil will be with you all the day if you do 
you should avoid look at the new moon through glass but if you have a wish that you want fulfil you have onli to count seven star on seven night in success 
let it be said howev that to count seven star for this space of time is not as simpl as it appear 
5 it is unlucki to treasur lock of peopl hair and should you drop a glove it is to your advantag if someon els pick it up for you 
if the fire refus to light proper in the morn anticip a whole day with the devil 
everybodi know that one of the luckiest thing that can be done is to pick up a horsesho 
but it is not general known that the more nail left in it the better 
nor is it suffici well recogn that a shoe hung up should have the tip point upward 
if they are turn down the luck will run out of them 
natur you will never start anyth fresh on a friday and you will not cut your fingernail on a sunday 
regard fingernail a poet of sort has said cut them on monday you cut them for news 
cut them on tuesday a new pair of shoe 
cut them on wednesday you cut them for health 
cut them on thursday you cut them for wealth 
cut them on friday a sweetheart youll know 
cut them on saturday a journey youll go 
cut them on sunday you cut them for evil for all the next week youll be rule by the devil 
of cours bad luck has not a monopoli on your superstit for good luck has someth to say also 
to see a piebald hors is fortun to find white heather fourleav clover or fourleav shamrock is even more fortun 
to open a peapod and find ten pea in it is particular lucki 
for a black cat to come into your hous is worth much 
to come across a nickel with a hole in it is not without it merit but the best thing of all is to put on some articl of cloth insid out and to wear it all day long without be awar of it until bedtim 
6 have you a talisman 
a person who find a fourleav clover and believ it is a harbing of someth good has adopt the right attitud for he keep a keen lookout for that particular good and hold out both hand for it 
seldom is he disappoint for he has unconsci set go the mental machineri which bring his wish within reach 
had he not found the clover and had gone along life highway unexpect of anyth good he would never have discov this pleasant happen 
and therein lie the true psycholog of luck which seem too simpl to be true but then it simplic is realli the signmanu of it veriti 
this quotat from the write of a wellknown author goe direct to the point about talisman 
if you adopt a talisman and put your faith in it you immedi prepar your mind for receiv an abund of good fortun 
reject all talisman and argu that there is no such thing as luck and you straightway set go the mental machineri which look on the dark side of thing and which miss everi slice of luck that come along 
therefor we say with emphasi take to yourself a talisman a mascot a charm—cal it what you will—and you will never regret it 
of talisman there are countless varieti some are known the world over other are the particular choic of individu 
they rang from the7 amulet and scarab of the ancient to the golliwog and cruditi of the ultramodern 
your choic may roam between these two extrem but whatev your choic it must be set with the seal of your faith 
in order to assist you in pick out a talisman for yourself we append the follow account of those exampl which are favor most— the horseshoe—no symbol is a greater favorit than the horsesho 
there are mani legend regard it origin but the most common accept concern the wellknown visit of his satan majesti to the shoesmith 
as a consequ the devil evinc a wholesom dread of horsesho and would not go near a hous or person possess one 
it is more like howev that the horsesho was accept as a symbol of luck becaus it was a commonplac object veri near the same shape as the metal crescent worn by the roman when they want to be fortun 
these crescent were alway carri with the horn turn up and if a horsesho is to bring good luck it too must be place with the prong uppermost 
the reason for the prong be so turn depend on a belief that misfortun alway travel in circl but when it reach the tip of a horsesho it is baffl unless all the luck has alreadi run out of the tip through them be turn downward 
of cours an old worn shoe is more lucki than a new one and it is a recogn fact that the more nail found in it the luckier will be the finder 
the scarab—thi devic is account veri lucki or veri unlucki accord to the disposit of the wearer 
the symbol repres the8 scarab beetl with it wing outspread or with them close 
such charm are made today in larg number for sale in egypt but those who trade in them usual claim that each particular specimen has been in the famili sinc biblic time 
as a rule the devic is made in a rough kind of bluish porcelain and is carv in intaglio with divin figur 
the egyptian use to make up the scarab as a neck pendant or as a littl ornament for place in the coffin of the dead 
it mission was to scare away the evil one 
no 
2—an egyptian scarab such as were use as talismen 
two form are shown one with the pector wing outspread the other with wing close 
the tet—thi symbol was shape somewhat like a mallet and was alway worn with the head uppermost and the handl hang down 
it was made in porcelain or stone and was often color gaudili 
the egyptian were the first to find efficaci in this charm and they wore it suspend around the neck to ward off attack from visibl and invis enemi 
thus it was a protect against evil in ani form it was also suppos to provid the wearer with strength and endur 
the tet has been much forgotten of late year but there are adher who valu it abov the horsesho and almost ani other charm 
no 
3—the talisman on the left is the tet on the right the arrowhead 
the arrowhead—th earli briton spent a great deal of their time in take suitabl flint and shape them into the form of triangl 
these were call arrowhead and when the two side edg had been sharpen they were fix into stick and use as weapon or tool 
out of this use grew the idea that arrowhead were potent charm in provid bodili protect against enemi forc or the usual ill 
accord peopl began to wear them as neck ornament and for this purpos decor arrowhead were made 
ever sinc then they have been cherish for their power in ward off attack and a superstit still exist which claim that if one of these arrowhead is dip in water the water will be more potent than ani doctor medicin 
the caduceus—thi devic which figur as part of the design of9 some postag stamp has been consid a bringer of good fortun ever sinc the time of the ancient greek 
it consist of two snake entwin a rod surmount by a pine cone 
by the side of the cone is a pair of wing 
it was the symbol of mercuri 
the rod had the supernatur power of quell disput and let peopl dwell in harmoni 
the snake possess the properti of heal the pine cone preserv good health and the wing stood for speed and progress 
thus peopl wear the caduceus today in order to ensur a life free from quarrel and ill and to enabl them to be healthi and go ahead 
no 
4—the caduceus or staff of mercuri 
the eye agate—a is general appreci the evil eye is the sourc of all troubl and misfortun and the earli eastern race thought that if the evil eye could be avoid or frighten away all would be well 
search for a charm to effect their purpos they alight upon the eye agat and this they believ would give no quarter to the evil eye 
accord agat were cut to resembl an eye which would be power enough to neutral the effect of the evil one and these were worn as brooch ring and necklac 
the agat chosen for the purpos consist of thin layer of stone of various color 
thus by cut the stone oval and removing10 part of the top layer it was possibl to produc a charm close resembl a human eye both in shape and color 
such eye are still sold today and mani peopl treasur them in the hope that they will ward off evil in ani form 
the jade axehead—mani jewel still sell littl axehead carv out of jade for wear around the neck 
the axehead has been consid a symbol of strength and vigor ever sinc primit time and jade has a worldwid reput as a charm against diseas and accid 
the seal of solomon—thi devic is now regard as a symbol of the jewish religion but it can be trace to sever other religion and no doubt it date even farther back than the commenc of the jewish era 
the triangl with the upward point stood for good the triangl with the downward point for wicked while the two intertwin symbol the triumph of good over bad 
those who wear the devic contend that it preserv them from all that is ill and at the same time it give them a share of the world bless

the dollar and the cent are pour in at a remark rate and those who read the futur as a profess are have the time of their live 
this state of thing is one calcul to make you stop and think for a moment 
whi should not you learn the rudiment of fortunetel yourself 
whi should not you find out how to read the sign of your own futur and the futur of your friend 
the subject is interest it is not a difficult one and all you need to know is set out in this book 
your cours of studi may well begin with the chapter on palmistri 
have master that turn to the one on handwrit and follow with what do your bump mean 
these three section will give you a veri use start and then you might continu with how astrolog decid your destini and your face is your fortun 
the five chapter name will enabl you to read peopl with a great deal of success and it should not be long befor your friend compliment you on your accuraci

never jump to hasti conclus 
weigh all the fact and strike a balanc 
if the hand say yes and the face say no the conclus is that it may be 
when disappoint thing are note be charit and let the applic off light 
in case where dire ill are portend suppress the fact or state them in such a way that the applic has a chanc of avoid the troubl if he or she take suitabl measur 
but whatev happen never make a statement for which you have not chapter and vers 
and this bring me to my last point 
hand face head and other characterist give their read but none of these read should be taken as absolut final 
the power is within us to fight against our fail and to better our good qualiti 
we may even allow our best one to deterior 
that is whi two peopl born at the same time and in the same town need not grow up exact alik

13 palmistry—what may be learn from hand there are more thing in heaven and earth peopl who can see as far as the end of their nose and then onli through a fog declar with a superior sniff that palmistri is noth but a trap to catch fool they call it quackeri or declar perhap that it is mere a fake or blind guesswork 
now while we would be the first to deni that palmistri is an exact and infal scienc yet we just as strong affirm that it is undoubt a most fascin and interest recreat as to it truth each one must decid that question for himself 
for the few who have a wish to take up this studi serious there are mani now who will natur wish to know just suffici to be abl to tell fortun 
fortunetel are alway popular at some jolli parti or quiet friend gather of an even 
in this book they will find all the simpl inform requir on the other hand the student will find a sincer delight in read and sift thorough the numer book that probe the depth of the subject 
quit apart from ani mark which may be upon the hand a general indic of the habit and tempera of the individu in question can readili be gain by a care examin of the textur or qualiti of the skin 
it were as well to note here that the impress gain must never be taken by themselv but onli in conjunct with other confirm sign 
especi is this so when judg the charact of a friend or acquaint 
textur of skin—th skin may of cours be smooth or rough 
to judg this you should turn the hand in question back upward now get the feel of the skin by actual touch a smooth finetextur skin denot a refin natur and vice versa 
this is a veri strong indic inde insomuch that should there be other tendenc point to coars of natur this textur of the hand would have a refin effect upon the whole 
elast of the hand—thi is best test by actual grip as in shake hand 
all hand natur present some feel of elast this is a matter of comparison but it is veri easi to tell the quick viril grip of an elast hand to the dead fish feel which a flabbi hand give us when we grasp it 
a flexibl hand denot an activ and energet person one who will be readili adapt to new condit

6—bewar of these hands—a show a weak flatten thumb b a curv littl finger and c a coars short thumb 
each has other defect as well 
15 a flabbi hand—on that doe not respond to your grip or respond but sluggishly—i the hand of an idl man untrustworthi and inconsist a man of weak and negat charact but be sure to search well for other confirm sign of this weak 
the shape of the hand a fair accur guid to charact is certain contain in the shape of the hand 
hand may be rough divid into two classes—broad and long 
a person have a long hand you may judg to have great capac for mental effort and matter of detail 
the broadhand person you may expect to be a strong man physic his cultur will be bodili rather than mental 
he could with advantag improv his cultur by read and by enjoy the best music 
the shape of the finger when an individu is found with squar fingertip he should make a good marriag partner he will be practical—a man of method and reason 
he is punctual but should cultiv imagin 
point finger tip will be found on the hand of the musician the painter and in fact anyon who is of artist tempera 
person with these finger should curb their imagin with reason and cultiv the power of do thing not onli dream them though dream is well enough in it way 
taper finger indic peopl of extrem 
ice and fire are these people—impuls and generous to a fault 
they should guard against undu and morbid sensit and should cultiv a sane philosoph outlook upon life 
they are capabl of the highest but are frequent their own worst enemi 
spatul fingers—thes are the sportsmen of the world 
they are not worri much by the opinion of other while they love a busi healthi life a sound mind in a sound bodi 
general shape and format of the hand if the hand are knot with the joint swollen power of analysi calcul and reflect are shown philosoph have this type of hand

begin at the top these should be judg by length as follows— 1

thus a long first or top phalang indic great will power or if it is not a certain indic it point to a definit likelihood of the will be strong 
the mount take your subject hand and examin it close a strong magnifi glass should form part of the equip of everi wise palmist 
it will be seen that there are certain portion of the hand which are rais abov the surfac

they are eight in number name jupit mercuri venus saturn apollo luna and mar of which there are two 
your handwrit reveal your charact your handwrit is you disguis it as you will it still reveal your charact 
as a matter of fact it is a sheer imposs for an ordinari person to alter his or her write complet 
the natur hand and the purposelychang hand will bear sever resembl howev hard the individu may tri to make them dissimilar

the scienc of phrenolog which is the read of bump has discov that bump in certain place point to certain characterist if you have them you must have the characterist and if you have not them you cannot have those qualiti 
in fact the read of charact through the medium of bump is a veri definit scienc and it is a scienc that can be easili learn and appli by almost anyon 
of cours there is much to learn but there is no need to know a great deal if you mere want to assess a person charact in general term 
a chart is suppli on p 47 and on it is mark out just enough to enabl you to read a head with eas 
onli certain area are map out the rest of the head may be the locat of bump but it doe not present the bump which are like to interest us just now 
the area are as follows— 1—li at the top of the head in the center and come a littl way toward the forehead

49 how astrolog decid your destini astrolog is one of the oldest scienc in the world 
it is said to have origin with the egyptian almost at the veri begin of time 
inde it is almost imposs to trace a period when this scienc was not practic 
there is noth new under the sun and it close follow will scarc allow ani error in it deduct 
they go so far as to declar it to be an exact scienc a term which mean that everyth can be reason out and prove noth is left to guesswork 
such scienc are mathemat algebra and geometri 
we need not believ that astrolog is all this but certain some veri startl and accur predict have been made by astrolog 
howev as in all other method of fortunetel attempt by us mortal it is far from infal 
so long as we do not take it to be exact and sure we shall get plenti of amus and interest from it studi with the excit feel all the time at the back of our mind that it might come true 
here is a list give you the name and mean given to planet by astrolog 
name 
approxim mean given by astrolog 
mar 
strength 
venus 
beauti 
mercuri 
capac for adapt oneself 
uranus 
improv 
sun 
life 
jupit 
freedom and growth 
saturn 
diminished—shrinking—lack of growth 
neptun 
abl to receive—recept 
earth 
physical—not spiritu 
the moon 
feel 
the main idea at the back of astrolog is that the planet or starri bodi which revolv round the sun each have a strong and vari influenc upon the mind of human be 
the zodiac—of cours when the planet revolv round the sun they travel through a cours or path 
the zodiac is the name given by astronom to the boundari which enclos this cours or path in the sky 
the sign of the zodiac are the space into which the zodiac is divid 
50 here are the sign of the zodiac arrang in order to show which sign are opposit to each other 
ari 
face libra 
taurus 
scorpio 
gemini 
sagittarius 
cancer 
capricorn 
leo 
aquarius 
virgo 
pisc 
now each sign has a planet which is said to rule it this is call the rule planet 
it is from the natur of this planet that the probabl charact and fate of the individu are told 
it is not necessari to know the whys and wherefor of this if you have not studi astronomi it will onli serv to muddl you and if on the other hand you do understand astronomi you will not need ani explan 
we will just say what doe happen and that will tell you all you need in these first step 
well we all know that the earth revolv upon it axi onc in everi 24 hour 
now accord to astronom this caus one of the zodiac sign to appear in the eastern sky where it remain for two hour 
we have said that each sign has a planet rule it so the sign that appear on the sky at the time of birth decid what planet that person is born under or is influenc by 
let us suppos for a moment that you were born when the sign libra was rise as the say is 
the planet which rule libra is venus so the person born at that time would be a venus type ie a person have the influenc of venus upon him 
in addit to the main rule planet astrolog will tell you that there are other neighbor planets—w will call them neighbor becaus it is a simpl term—which also have their effect upon us 
astrolog call this one planet be in aspect with anoth 
for instanc you might have the planet mar in aspect with or influenc by the planet saturn you would then be deal with a veri strong charact 
the qualiti of mar which give the fighter and the push type or in excess the bulli will be well steadi by the qualiti of saturn which by themselv give cold and in excess lack of feel 
the two togeth result in a charact remark for it steadi combin with it neverweari energi and good balanc 
so you see we seldom find pure type ie qualiti of mar or other planet by themselv and it is veri fortun that this is so we should get a veri onesid world if we did 
now we come to that part of astrolog which realli interest most peopl here will be shown the birthdat for each month in the year and the probabl charact of person born at that special time 
you may ask whi the charact are given and whi not the fate or futur of the person concern 
the reason is this you can be pretti sure that what you read of an individu charact will give you a sound idea of what in all probabl his futur will be 
51 after all the carv out of our live is in our own hand 
we are the master of our fate or as the song has it captain of our soul 
howev if we believ astrolog there is a way to tell the time of our live when matter should go smooth or the revers 
the most favor time for specul with money start in busi in fact the most and least favor period of our live can accord to astrolog be work out by what is known as the horoscop 
now this horoscop is in realiti a chart of your life 
the rocki water are shown and the barrier reef which each of us must avoid through our life so you will see a use in the studi of astrolog 
it would seem to be natur warn to us all of the necess for effort effort and again effort 
here are the birth date and characterist of person born between the date mention 
sinc astrolog is not infal do not take all these characterist too serious 
you will notic that each date is taken from about the 20th of one month to the 20th of the next month 
when were you born

your own number but there is much more in the scienc of number than that which can be glean from the day of the week 
there is your own person number the number which influenc you and your action more than ani other 
if you know your number think how you can use it for good and avoid other for ill 
the find of your number is a simpl matter when you have master the element of numerolog which is the scienc of number 
let us explain how your own number is found 
first write down your birthdat the day of the month the month itself and the year 
thus three item are requir 
take first the day of the month 
if it consist of one figur leav it 
if it consist of two add them togeth and if the answer come to two figur add them togeth 
all this may appear a littl involv but it is not as one or two exampl will show 
suppos you were born on the 9th of the month then 9 is the number you want 
but suppos it was the 16th then six and one make seven 
therefor 7 is the requir number 
again if you were born on the 29th then nine and two make eleven but as eleven consist of two figur you must add them togeth and they make 2 
so much for the day of the month now for the month itself 
januari stand for one februari for 2 and so on to decemb for 12 
the number of the month from januari to septemb can stand as they are but octob novemb and decemb be 10 11 and 12 must be ad up as alreadi describ 
thus octob is one novemb is two and decemb three 
third the number of the year must be consid 
say you were born in 1910 
these figur add up to eleven and eleven be doubl figur add up to 2 
therefor 1910 is equival to 2 
work out your figur here 
you have now obtain three separ figur add them togeth and if they come to a onefigur number that is the number which you requir 
on the other hand if it is a doublefigur amount add the two figur as befor until you arriv at a singlefigur amount 
then that is the number you requir 
so as to make the whole thing perfect clear we will take a complet exampl and work it out exact as you must work out your own birthdat 
example—12th septemb 1913 
12 1 2 3 septemb is the 9th month 9 1913 1 9 1 3 14 1 4 5 3 9 5 17 1 7 8 63 therefor the person number of anyon born on 12th septemb 1913 is 8 
eight should guid and influenc all his or her action 
we are not go to pretend that benefit will accru on everi occas that the person number is observ but we are go to say that we have note some marvel piec of good fortun when it has 
when you have found your person number there are sever way in which you can use it 
suppos your number is the one just found eight then you can conclud that the eighth day of ani month will be a propiti one for you 
but that is not the onli one 
the 17th is equal good becaus one plus seven give eight 
moreov the 26th is in a similar posit 
two and six make eight 
yet anoth way to use your person number aris when you want to know whether some import step should be taken on a definit day 
what is the particular day 
add up it numerolog valu exact as you did with your birthday and if it resolv itself into the same number as your person number you may go ahead with cheer 
put forth your best effort and on the day you will have ampl chanc of success 
the number of your name numerolog permit of still anoth step 
take your own name and see what number it is equal to 
you will be abl to do this in the follow way a stand for one b for two c for three and so on 
when you reach i which is 9 commenc again and give j the valu of one then continu 
to make all this clear we will set out the valu of the complet alphabet 1 a j s 2 b k t 3 c l u 4 d m v 5 e n w 6 f o x 7 g p y 8 h q z 9 i r — thus suppos your name is joan shirley the letter resolv themselv into the follow numbers— j o a n s h i r l e y 1 6 1 5 1 8 9 9 3 5 7 55 55 5 5 10 1 0 1 from all that we have said it will be clear that the birthdat may be use for find the person number or the letter of the name may be use 
on rare occas the two way will provid the same number 
when this is the case great faith should be place in that number 
but when the two way give differ number what 
doe one disprov the other 
no 
you64 simpli have two number favor to you 
the birthdat number is the more definit and reliabl becaus your veri exist is base on it 
a word at the end 
marri ladi must use their maiden name for find the name number 
your lucki color the old say green for grief is a wellknown one and the writer would rather wear ani color on earth than green not even a green scarf or belt 
moreov she see to it that the other member of the famili do not indulg in the unlucki color 
but mind you green onli bring her illfortun when use for wear apparel 
there is no object of cours to a green frontdoor nor to wallpap of the same color 
for such use green play it part harmless enough 
though green dress are more distress to the writer than a red rag to a bull she is quit prepar to admit that mani peopl find it a veri lucki color 
this bring us to the point 
there is no color that is univers unlucki it is onli so in the hand of certain individu 
with other it may be an absolut harbing of all that is lucki 
even green may do this 
now the question is which is your lucki color 
if you know it well and good 
make use of it in everi possibl way 
when wear dress made of it you will feel more confid of yourself than when array in someth els 
you will get more work done and it will be better work 
the onli thing is that you must be sure that it is your lucki color 
if you are not quit sure the tonic effect is absolut lost 
not onli should you wear your fortun color but it is a good plan to surround yourself with it 
we know a woman who pin her faith to purpl 
her dress are most purpl the wallpap in her bedroom is purpl purpl casement curtain adorn the window there are purpl rug in various part of the hous even the back of the hairbrush on her dress tabl is purpl 
and sinc she decid that purpl was her lucki color and use it in everi reason way she has had sever stroke of marvel good fortun 
but of cours you may say in repli to all this that you do not know your lucki color 
what then 
this is where we can give you a littl help

neptun revolv around the sun in it distant orbit onc in about 165 year 
uranus complet it orbit revolut in 84 year jupit in 12 year mar in about 15 month venus in 11 month and mercuri in 18 week 
if you imagin these bodi to be revolv in a plane around the sun and yourself to be stand within the sun the motion of these bodi will appear almost uniform and alway in one direct 
were the orbit of the planet circular and the sun hold the centr of the circl their motion would be constant that is to say alway in the same direct and at the same rate 
but the orbit are ellipt and the sun hold a posit in one of the foci of each ellips 
consequ the planet are at time further from the sun than at other and pg 18 they are then said to be in their aphelion the opposit point of the orbit where they are nearest to the sun be call the perihelion 
when at aphelion the planet move slower and when at perihelion they move quicker than at the mean distanc 
astronom employ an imaginari circular orbit for the planet in which they move at an uniform rate of veloc which is call the mean motion 
this is subject to an equat depend on the posit of the planet in it orbit and it determin the diﬀer between the imaginari planet and the true planet 
the equat itself depend on the eccentr of the orbit that is to say it relat to a circl drawn around the same focal centr 
the earth follow the same law as all other bodi of the same system 
but if we imagin the earth to be stationari in space and the centr around which the planet revolv their motion present sever irregular 
mercuri and venus will then appear to revolv around the sun while the sun revolv around the earth sometim be between the earth and the sun which is call an inferior conjunct sometim on the further side of the sun away from the earth as at their superior conjunct and again at other time to the right or left of the sun in east or west elong 
the other planet have orbit greater than that of the earth will appear to revolv around it at constant vari distanc and veloc 
at certain point in their orbit they will appear to remain stationari in the same part of the zodiac 
the annex illustr will assist the lay reader perhap 
the bodi m is mercuri when at inferior conjunct with the sun pg 19 as seen from the earth 
the letter v is the planet venus at superior conjunct with the sun 
the point w and e are the point of greatest elong west and east and the letter s show the point in the orbit at which those bodi appear to be stationari when view from the earth at g as seen from the earth venus would appear to be direct and mercuri retrograd 
astrolog we regard the earth as the passiv subject of planetari inﬂuenc and we have therefor to regard it as the centr of the �eld of activ 
if we were make a horoscop for an inhabit of the planet mar we should make mar the centr of the system 
the planets’ posit are therefor taken as from the centr of the earth geocentr and not as from the centr of the sun heliocentr 
an astrolog ephemeri of the pg 20 planets’ motion is employ for this purpos see sect

pg 24 chapter ii the sign of the zodiac the zodiac is an imaginari belt of the heaven through which the sun and planet move in their appar revolut round the earth 
it extend from 23� 27′ abov the plane of the equat to the same distanc below it be bound by the tropic of cancer on the north and by that of capricorn on the south 
the eclipt is a circl transect this belt at an angl of 23� 27′ to the plane of the equat 
the point where it cut the equat are call the equinox 
the eclipt is divid into twelv equal section count from the vernal equinox 
these are call the sign of the zodiac 
each sign occupi 30 degre of the circl 
their name and symbol are as follows— 1 
ari the ram ♈ 7

everi altern sign begin with ari is male and the rest are femal 
ari male taurus femal gemini male cancer femal c the sign ari leo capricornus are call barren while taurus cancer scorpio and pisc are fruit 
ari govern the east cancer the north libra the west and capricornus the south 
the doublebodi sign are gemini sagittarius and pisc 
it is import that all these classi�c should be learn as they form an essenti part of the doctrin of astrolog and are frequent employ in the read of a horoscop 
the type of peopl under the various sign should also be known as intim as possibl 
a person is said to be “under� a sign—that is to say under it inﬂuenc when that sign is rise in the east at the moment of birth 
pg 26 you will recognis these type among your friend and associates— ari produc a person of lean bodi long neck high cheekbon grey eye sandi or sad brown hair which is either wiri and straight or crisp and curl

pisc produc one of rather short statur short limb lymphat bodi pale complexion limpid blue eye black or brown eye short nose full lip round face small hand and feet 
the short sign are taurus cancer capricornus and pisc 
the tall sign are gemini leo sagittarius and aquarius 
the other are of medium height 
the planet rise in each sign will alway alter the type by impress their own characterist on the subject 
each sign has a ruler and the posit of the ruler of the rise sign has much to do with the physic conform as if taurus be rise and venus it ruler be in leo the person will be taller and fairer than pg 28 indic by taurus alon 
pure type are veri uncommon 
the rulership of the planet in the sign is as follows— saturn govern aquarius and capricornus 
jupit govern pisc and sagittarius 
mar govern ari and scorpio 
venus govern taurus and libra 
mercuri govern gemini and virgo 
the moon govern cancer and leo is govern by the sun 
when a planet is found in a sign over which it is said to govern it act more strong than usual and when in the opposit sign to those it govern it is said to be in it “fall� when it is weaker than usual 
planet govern opposit sign to one anoth are said to be “enemies� such do not produc harmoni and favour result when act in conjunct 
pg 29 chapter iii the celesti hous the imaginari circl which pass immedi over your head as you face the south is call the prime vertic 
this is divid for astrolog purpos into twelv equal divis call hous six of which are abov the horizon and six below it 
they are count from the east horizon under the earth to the west and thenc through the zenith to the east again 
the �gure in section iv chapter v will make the idea easi of comprehens 
each such divis or hous carri it own signi�c and it has been ascertain beyond all doubt or cavil that the rule of the ancient in this matter is altogeth reliabl howev empir it may appear 
the first hous govern the person appear but chieﬂi the face and head 
the second hous rule over �nanc movabl eﬀect commerc 
in the bodi it govern the neck and throat 
the third hous govern short journey letter and other mean of communic near relat or neighbour 
in the bodi it govern the arm and lung 
the fourth hous govern real estat the resid the produc of the earth the mother of pg 30 the subject and the end of life 
in the bodi the breast and thorax 
the fifth hous govern progeni the sex instinct domest relat and social pleasur 
in the bodi the back and heart 
the sixth hous govern the health servant and person comfort of the subject cloth food and other physic requisit sanit hygien 
in the bodi it rule over the abdomen and lower viscera 
the seventh hous has dominion over marriag contract agreement partner and matter of exchang 
in the bodi it has relat to the loin and kidney 
the eighth hous rule death loss legaci and dowri and matter appertain to the deceas 
in the bodi it is relat to the excretori system 
the ninth hous is said to govern long journey public religi belief foreign land and legal aﬀair

the twelfth hous rule ambush restraint privat imprison con�nement and all limit of the person freedom 
in the bodi it rule the ankl and feet 
appli these signi�c to the interpret of a horoscop it will be seen that if mar should be rise at the moment of birth there will be a scar or mark on the face 
observ of this sort will frequent assist to determin the time of birth when it is not known 
similar with other planet in the same or other hous but of this more anon 
pg 31 chapter iv the astronom aspect aspect are certain angular distanc measur on the eclipt and they form a fundament part of astrolog scienc 
ani planet may be good or bad in it eﬀect on the charact and destini accord to the aspect that it throw to the chief point of the horoscop 
the aspect are the semisquar aspect of 45 degre sextil of 60 degre squar of 90 degre trine of 120 degre sesquiquadr of 135 degre and the opposit of 180 degre 
there is also the conjunct when bodi are in the same degre or part of a sign 
the good aspect are the trine and sextil the evil be the semisquar squar sesquiquadr and opposit 
the aspect of a planet determin it eﬀect whether for good or evil 
the conjunct is good with good planet such as jupit and venus and evil with malef planet such as mar and saturn 
when planet are the same distanc north or south of the equat they are in parallel declin pd 
and they then act as if in conjunct 
also when planet are in mutual disposit that is to say occupi one another’ sign they act as if they were in conjunct 
planet in conjunct act accord to their simpl natur but when in aspect accord to the natur of that pg 32 aspect 
the bene�c planet jupit venus sun moon and also mercuri when in good disposit with anoth planet or in a congeni sign produc good eﬀect by their conjunct and by their trine and sextil aspect but when in squar semisquar or sesquisquar aspect they are uniform evil in eﬀect 
on the other hand the male�c planet neptun uranus saturn and mar togeth with mercuri when illdispos or in uncongeni sign are evil in their eﬀect when in conjunct with the signi�c point of the horoscop also when in evil aspect but they nevertheless produc good effect when in good aspect

the more import point of the horoscop to which aspect can be thrown are call “signi�cators� the general signi�c in ani horoscop are the sun the moon the midheaven the degre which hold the meridian of the horoscop and the ascend the degre which is rise 
but everi planet can be a particular signif in it own provinc name in the sign which it rule and the hous in which it is found at birth 
in a general sens the moon is signi�c of the mother femal relat the person health and fortun and the chang incid to these 
the sun in the same way indic the father male relat the vital principl and posit 
mercuri is the signi�c of the mind and intellect the faculti general 
venus is signi�catrix of love aﬀair domest relat pleasur and of young femal relat sister c mar is signi�c of pg 33 enterpris strife and young male relat 
jupit is signi�c of increas and emolu saturn of legaci inherit and age person uranus of civic and government bodi neptun of voyag and psychic experi 
the chief point to be regard howev are the midheaven the ascend and the place of the sun and moon 
pg 34 section ii the construct of a horoscop chapter i the ephemeri and it use an ephemeri is an almanac of the planetari posit day by day throughout ani given year 
they are to be obtain at a cost of one shill per year in a conveni form special adapt to the use of astrolog 
in the �rst column will be found the sider time for the day which is the sun’ right ascens or distanc from the vernal equinox express in hour minut and second and equat to mean time at greenwich 
by mere ad the time after noon or subtract the hour and minut befor noon at which the birth took place you will obtain the right ascens of the midheaven at the moment of birth 
the use to which this is put will appear in the next chapter 
it correspond to a particular degre of the zodiac which is in the midheaven at the given time of birth 
the next column contain the sun’ longitud at noon for each day 
by take the posit on one day fromthat pg 35 on the next day the motion of the sun for 24 hour is obtain and a proport of this for the hour of birth can easili be made 
the mean motion of the sun per day is 2�′ or 1 degre per day 
in anoth column will be found the moon’ longitud and in adjac column it declin and latitud 
declin is distanc north or south of the equat and celesti latitud is distanc north or south of the eclipt 
the longitud of the other bodi are also given for each day at noon 
the mean longitudin progress of the sever bodi is as follow sun2�′ per hour or 1 degre per day moon 32′ per hour or 13 degre per day neptun 2′ per day uranus 3′ per day saturn about 5′ per day jupit about 12′ per day mar 45′ per day or about 2′ per hour venus 72′ per day or 3′ per hour mercuri 84′ per day or 3�′ per hour 
these increment are for direct motion onli the planet are as alreadi explain sometim retrograd and sometim stationari 
the horoscop of birth is onli concern with the longitud of the planet but when one or more planet have the same declin north or south they should be note as be in parallel for they then act as if they were in conjunct 
take in hand then the ephemeri for the year of your birth and read this chapter with it in view 
after understand it construct extract the sider time at noon for the day of your birth and refer to the next chapter 
pg 36 chapter ii to erect a figur of the heaven take the sider time at noon on the day of birth and add to it the hour and minut after noon at which you were born or if befor noon subtract from it the interv between the birth and noon 
this will give the approxim right ascens of the midheaven at birth 
thus suppos a person to be born on may 1 1890 at 3h 
30m 
pm in london— the sider time noon may 1 1890 is 2h 
36m 
28s 
to which add time pm …… … 3 30 0 acceler at 10″ per hour … … 0 0 34 right ascens of midheaven at birth 6h 
7m 
2s 
with this right ascens of the midheaven you then refer to tabl of hous for london seechapt iii 
and against this quantiti of sider time you will �nd under the column mark 10 the sign and degre which correspond to it name the 2nd of cancer 
this is put at the head of the �gure and the rest of the sign are place around the �gure in their order as shown in the tabl 
onli six of the hous are given in the tabl pg 37 becaus the opposit hous will have the same degre of the opposit sign on them 
thus we read against the right ascens 6h 
7m 
28s 
the following— 10 11 12 ascen 
2 3 cancer leo virgo libra scorp 
libra 133 2 8 8 26 26 
this mean that the 2nd degre of cancer was on the cusp of the tenth hous the midheaven at the moment of the birth leo 8th on the cusp of the eleventh hous virgo 8th on the cusp of the twelfth libra 133 on the ascend or eastern horizon and so of the rest 
on the cusp of the fourth hous we place capricornus 2 becaus the fourth hous is opposit the 10th and the sign capricornus is opposit to cancer 
on the cusp of the fifth hous we place aquarius 8 becaus the fifth hous is opposit to the eleventh and aquarius is opposit to leo 
when complet we find the cusp of the hous as follow opposit to those in the tables— 4 5 6 7 8 9 capric 
aquar 
pisc ari taur 
ari 133 2 8 8 26 26 
it is then onli necessari to place the planet in the �gure as explain in thepreced chapter and the �gure of the heaven is complet 
to draw a figur of the heaven 
take a pair of compass and with a radius of about 2� inch describ a circl 
within this and with a radius of about 2 inch describ anoth 
with the radius of this latter mark oﬀ six equal divis and then equal pg 38 divid these so as to make twelv 
within the �gure draw a small circl concentr with the other to repres the earth 
from the point of divis alreadi obtain draw straight line to the centr of the �gure until they touch the circl of the earth 
you then have a �gure which repres the hous of the heaven be a twelvefold divis of the prime vertic 
the line extend from the outer circl to the earth are the cusp of the hous see fig 
section iv chap 
5 
the degre of the zodiac which are upon the cusp of the hous as found in the tabl opposit a given sider time are written over the sever cusp in their order between the two outer circl 
refer to the ephemeri for may 1 1890 show the sun at noon in taurus 11 degre 2 minut 
three and a half hour later it will have advanc about 8 minut in longitud so that it posit will be in taurus 11 degre 10 minut 
this longitud fall in the eighth hous and we therefor place the symbol of the sun in that divis of the heaven and place against it the �gure 1110 so that as ari 26 is on the cusp of the eighth and taurus 26 on the cusp of the ninth hous the sun’ posit in taurus 1110 will fall between these cusp ie in the eighth hous 
the rest of the planet are place in the figur accord to their respect longitud 
pg 39 chapter iii the tabl of hous the tabl of the hous on pp 
40 41 are calcul for the latitud of 51� 32′ north 
this will serv for london and environ and approxim for the south of england and the midland 
tabl of hous for other latitud may be obtain through the booksel a use set of half a dozen diﬀer latitud be sold for one shill 
in order to illustr the use to which these tabl may be put in the solut of astronom problem let us take the sun’ posit in the horoscop for the 1st of may 1890 and �nd when the sun set on that day on the horizon of london 
the sun is in taurus 11 degre and it will set when the opposit point of the heaven is rise 
find under the column mark “ascen� the 11th degre of scorpio and against it in the column mark “sider time� you will �nd 9h 
49m 
9s 
this will be the right ascens of the midheaven when the sun set on london 
we have alreadi seen that the sider time at noon on the 1st of may was 2h 
37m 
28s and this taken from the former sider time give about 712 pm as the time of sunset 
now in the exampl horoscop the birth took place at 330 pm and this time taken from 712 pm give 3h 
42m 
from birth to sunset 
if you multipli this by 15 to turn it into degre and minut of the equat you will obtain 55� 30′ which are the number of degre which pass over the midheaven from birth until sunset 
at the rate of 1 degre for everi year of life this correspond to 55� year of age when the subject of this horoscop would come under the advers inﬂuenc of the sun opposit ascend and would suﬀer some serious ill health of a feverish natur incid to the throat the part rule by taurus the sign in which the sun is situat 
this is how predict are made but of this more anon

thus in the case of one born on the 1st of may at 330 pm the 30th year come under the midheaven of leo 2 which is 30 degre further advanc than cancer 2 and under leo 2 in the 10th hous i �nd the ascend to be in libra 247 which is the ascend govern that year of life 
the mean and import of these calcul will appear at a later stage of this exposit 
when a degre is on the midheaven or the 10th hous it is said to “culminate� and when on the horizon eastward it is said to “ascend� the midheaven is often call the “mc� medium coeli and the opposit point is call the “ic� imaum coeli 
they are the point of the eclipt which cut through the meridian of a place at ani given time 
section iii how to read the horoscop chapter i the planet in the hous it is imposs to categor state the eﬀect which are due to the posit of the planet in the sever hous becaus veri much depend upon the sign they are in and the aspect they have from other planet 
the mean of judg the eﬀect is veri simpl when onc the natur of the planet and the dominion of the sever hous have been thorough digest 
thus it is �rst necessari to see in what hous a planet is situat 
then consid the natur of the planet in the follow concret manner neptun mean chao confus decept 
uranus eccentr origin estrang 
saturn privat hindranc denial 
jupit affluenc fruit increas

pg 52 moon chang public 
now look to the thing that are govern by the hous in which ani particular planet is situat at the moment of birth sect 
i chap 
iii 
suppos saturn to be found in the 11th hous 
saturn is “privation� and the 11th hous is the domain of “friends� henc a pauciti of friend or such as there may be are evil or unfortun to the subject 
jupit in the 2nd hous in the same manner would signifi “increase� of “money and possessions� mar in the 7th would indic “quarrels� with “partners� and so on 
each planet reﬂect it own natur upon the aﬀair govern by the hous in which it is found at the moment of birth 
it will not infrequ happen howev that there are more than one planet in the same hous 
suppos two planet to occupi the same hous 
in such case one may be good jupit and the other evil mar 
it is then necessari to take �rst that which �rst come to the horizon or midheaven that is to say the one which is in the earlier part of the hous and next that which follow 
thus saturn follow by jupit in the 11th hous would signifi misfortun by mean of advis and friend follow at a later period in the life by some great good through the same sourc 
the degre which separ the planet will indic the year which elaps between these chang of fortun 
similar if there be more than two planet in the same hous in such case you may safe predict mani chang in that depart of life which the hous is said to rule 
but the fact of a planet be in a hous is not of itself suﬃcient evid from which to make a judgment 
the pg 53 aspect which that planet has must also be consid for in this matter saturn when throw a good aspect to ani of the signi�cators—th sun moon ascend or midheaven and well aspect by other planet is to be prefer to jupit when the latter is bad place and aspect for jupit has his own ill eﬀect and saturn has his good inﬂuenc 
jupit is onli a bene�c when act by conjunct or good aspect with anoth planet and saturn is onli a malef when act by conjunct or evil aspect 
these thing be duli consid it is possibl to arriv with even brief experi at the result that are signifi by the planet in the sever hous 
pg 54 chapter ii the constitut the sun is the chief signi�c of the constitut and the aspect he hold to the other planet are to be consid 
thus if he be found in good aspect or at least not in evil aspect to the other planet the constitut may be judg as sound 
when howev the sun is aﬄict by some planet and assist by other there will be onli a moder constitut and judgment has to be made as to which inﬂuenc predomin the good or evil 
when the aﬄict planet are angular—that is to say in the 1st 4th 7th or 10th houses—th congenit or hereditari tendenc to organ diseas is by that circumst so much the stronger 
but when the assist planet are angular the predisposit to diseas is consider mitig and in most case entir overcom 
the predisposit of the bodi to aﬀect of a constitut natur is to be judg from the preval of evil aspect to the sun and the part of the bodi liabl to be aﬀect are judg from the sign which are occupi by the afflict bodi 
the various aﬀect due to the sever planet have alreadi been cite sect 
i chap 
i 
the sign are group for purpos of patholog studi as follows— the movabl signs—ari cancer libra and capricornus—hav relat to the head stomach skin kidney pg 55 liver and spine 
the fix signs—taurus leo scorpio and aquarius—ar relat to the throat heart blood and excretori system 
the common signs—gemini virgo sagittarius and pisces—ar relat to the lung bowel and nervous system 
it will also be advis to read sect 
i chap 
ii in order to determin the special point liabl to aﬀect the natur of the affect be judg sole by the planet which cast the malef aspect to the sun 
when the sun is found to be aﬄict by sever planet and at the same time there is no assist from the good aspect or conjunct of other bodi then the constitut is deem faulti and liabl to earli disrupt 
but when there are sever planet aﬄict and at the same time some bene�c inﬂuenc from other it is probabl that there will be prolong diseas and physic weak though life will continu 
death in infanc occur when the male�c planet are immedi rise or culmin at the birth in evil aspect to the luminari which at the time may be abov the horizon 
also when there are male�c planet immedi set or pass the nadir in evil aspect to the luminari below the horizon 
but when there are mitig inﬂuenc from the good aspect of the bene�c planet or the luminari the male�c planet will not induc death but there will be great difficulti in rear 
pg 56 chapter iii health and sick the aspect of the moon are the chief consider in the matter of sick 
if the moon be found to be aﬄict by the evil aspect of sever planet and no assist be given by the good aspect of other then the health will be precari and frequent spell of ill will result 
the moon be well aspect and not in ani way aﬄict show that the health will be well establish and that there will be immun from sick of all sort 
the consider necessari to be made in this matter are similar to those which have been cite in regard to the sun and the constitut except that we substitut the moon for the sun 
for wherea the sun govern the vital power in man the moon govern the function power and wherea the sun denot those aﬀect which are congenit or hereditari the moon denot such as are brought about by caus after birth 
similar the sun denot aﬀect which are incident to the bodi while the moon denot such as are accident thereto 
these point be born in mind they may be memoris at sight— pg 57 sun 
moon 
organ 
function 
hereditari 
acquir 
incident 
accident 
but it should be observ that the constitut may be strong and the health may be at the same time veri bad or on the other hand the health may be good and the constitut may be weak 
in the �rst case there would be a long life of consider suﬀer from illhealth and in the second case there would be littl or no ill health for some consider time but the constitut would give way and the vital power becom deplet by the first serious ill that occur 
onli when the sun and moon are both unaﬄict by evil aspect or conjunct the health and constitut are both good and there is everi indic of a robust and vigor life reach to a ripe old age 
when the sun and moon are both heavili aﬄict and there is no assist given by good aspect there is everi probabl of death in infanc or befor reach matur 
for reason which are alli to the connect exist between the constitut and the health the good aspect of the moon to the sun at birth is an excel auguri for it indic coordin between the organ and function 
where this coordin exist there is alway consider power of recuper so that ill is easili overcom and the balanc of power restor in the system 
male�c planet rise and aﬄict either the sun or moon indic prolong illhealth and most frequent pg 58 some perman hurt to the bodi 
when predisposit to ill is shown in the horoscop the particular aﬀect can be determin by the sign which the aﬄict planet hold 
thus if saturn aﬄict the moon from ari you will judg some hurt and obstruct in the head chill and cold inﬂuenza coryza c similar mar in leo would indic function defect of the heart due to acceler action and overstrain such as result from fever 
a good aspect of the planet jupit and venus is of materi help in counteract the inﬂuenc of male�c aspect or evil posit 
thus it will be seen that the health may be judg entir apart from the constitut the planet which are in aspect to the moon be of first consider and next those which may be rise at the time of birth 
pg 59 chapter iv how to read charact and disposit ptolemi say “mercuri is the ruler of the ration soul the moon of the anim soul� by this he would mean no doubt that mercuri has relat to the faculti of the mind while the moon is relat to brain function 
there are certain attribut of the mind which are distinct of the human be and certain other qualiti which are common to man and the lower anim 
these latter are under the dominion of the moon while mercuri has chief signif of the ration faculti 
the posit and aspect of the moon and mercuri are therefor to be consid in make judgment of the mental endow and disposit of the subject 
planet that are in conjunct or aspect to either the moon or mercuri will impress their natur strong on the charact and disposit 
the natur of the planet have alreadi been recit sect 
i chap 
i 
and it is therefor onli necessari to consid further in this connect the natur of the aspect that is thrown to the mental signi�c by the other bodi 
thus the sun be in trine to the moon will give a proper degre of pg 60 independ and digniti while the squar aspect or opposit of the sun would indic an excess of pride harm to the subject in his ordinari relationship 
in the same manner the good aspect of jupit would show benevol and regul philanthropi while the opposit or other evil aspect of the same bodi would indic extravag and ostentati display of chariti 
the good and bad aspect of the planet may be sum up in a few line as follows— in good aspect 
in evil aspect 
neptune—genius inspir 
insan obsess 
uranus—origin invent 
obstinaci eccentr

the general trend of the disposit and habit of mind is judg by the posit of the major of the planet accord to the “constitution� of the sign they occupi 
thus the major of the planet be in— cardin or movabl sign indic execut abil busi aptitud pioneer spirit ambit capabl to cut out a line in life for oneself and to make headway against diﬃculti 
such person are usual the foremost in their particular sphere of life and are alway found in the most progress movement reform c fix signs—stabl patienc endur method caution and diplomaci 
such person are apt to becom pg 61 the origin of school of thought polici and scheme 
they have �xiti of purpos determin independ and pivot stabil 
they sit still and the world revolv around them 
flex or common signs—versatil flexibl suaviti adapt and lack of origin 
such peopl usual have too mani iron in the �re and take in hand more than they can bring to satisfactori conclus 
this is due to their versatil 
they have a super�ci knowledg of mani thing but lack the persist to bring that knowledg to practic eﬀect 
at the same time their adapt is the occas of mani success in life and their agreeabl sympathi and suaviti creat mani friend for them 
in the wheel of life the cardin sign denot the rim or tyre which is ever on the move have the greatest acceler 
the common sign repres the spoke of the wheel unit the tyre to the nave and in that sens repres the power of adapt 
the fix sign repres the nave which remain quiescent and still be use by that pivot stabil and appar nonent 
thus while the signgroup of the planet are use in give the keynot of the natur and disposit the particular faculti and characterist are to be judg onli from the aspect of the planet to the moon and mercuri 
further it will be note that those planet which occupi the 3rd and 9th hous and those also which are just rise at the moment of birth will strong impress themselv on the natur apart from ani aspect they may hold to the mental ruler 
this is on account of the natur relationship of those hous to the mind and it mean of express 
due attent must be paid to the posit and aspect of those planet which are in aspect to the mental pg 62 ruler for if they be bad place in uncongeni sign and themselv bad aspect by other planet they will not act with the same direct and forc as they otherwis would do 
it is of cours admit in all astrolog inquiri that the eﬀect of hered train and associ count for someth 
a man who is generat from a vitiat parentag bad nourish and imperfect train cannot be expect even with the best aspect to manifest the highest faculti in their fullest or most perfect express 
i have not the slightest doubt that mani a clodpol was born under similar aspect to those which obtain at the birth of shakespear raphael newton or c�sar 
i am not dismay

the inspir and ardent tempera is indic by the major of planet be in fieri sign 
the mental or intellectu tempera is shown by the major in aerial sign 
the psychic or emot tempera by the major in wateri sign and the practic or sordid tempera by the major be in earthi sign 
the rise sign at birth often impress itself strong on the mind of the subject and it characterist are those which belong to the planet which govern it and the “elemental� natur of the sign itself 
thus you have the chief key to the estim of charact in the individu and when onc the student is pg 63 convinc by experi of the paramount reliabl of this method of characterdelin it use will need no special point 
mental and brain disord 
when either the moon or mercuri is aﬄict by the male�c planet that is to say when neptun uranus saturn or mar are in conjunct or evil aspect with the mental signi�c and there be no reliev aspect from the bene�c planet jupit venus or the sun then there is everi predisposit to aﬀect of the brain and nervous system 
this is the more to be fear when the moon or mercuri is aﬄict in the ﬂex or common sign 
this observ has been scienti�c establish by mr a g trent in his littl work entitl “the soul and the stars� to which the student is refer for a mass of statist evid 
pg 64 chapter v financi prospect look to the planet which are in the 2nd hous and the aspect to them 
if ani planet be therein and well aspect by other the �nancial condit will be compet 
if a bene�c jupit or venus be therein and free from evil aspect the same eﬀect will accru 
but if the bene�c in the 2nd should have good aspect from other planet then there will be consider wealth 
ani planet in the 2nd hous bad aspect will produc diﬃculti in acquir money and if it be a male�c planet which occupi the 2nd hous under these condit there will be time of stress and even poverti 
continu hardship and poverti is shown by male�c planet in the 2nd hous in evil aspect to the moon or sun while at the same time the planet in the 2nd hous will be sever afflict by other 
saturn in the midheaven aﬄict the sun or moon is an indic of revers of fortun and such person usual attain consider posit in the world and are then deplet of everyth 
jupit or venus in the 10th hous and near the meridian are sign of good fortun and success in life and pg 65 the same result are due to their rise at birth 
in a general manner the aspect to the moon in a male horoscop or the sun in a femal horoscop should be consult and the planet in good aspect thereto will show the mean of good fortun while those in evil aspect will indic the sourc of loss and hurt accord to the hous the aﬄict or assist planet occupi 
thus jupit in good aspect to the moon from the 11th hous show gain by friend advis and co oper measur becaus the 11th hous rule these relationship and jupit is the index of increas 
similar uranus in the 7th hous would show gain by the marriag partner if in good aspect to the moon or loss therebi if in evil aspect 
mar in the 2nd hous show good earn capac becaus mar is an ambiti and industri planet ie it produc such eﬀect in the person and the 2nd hous is the domain of �nanc 
but at the same time it show extravag and inabl to save money for mar is impuls and lack thrift 
the 6th hous well occupi show faith and advantag servant and employ� such as will augment the fortun and do good work for the subject 
neptun in the 2nd show complic and an involv state of �nanc and frequent it show loss by fraud and imposit though in good aspect to other planet it show gain by such nefari mean 
uranus indic mani up and down of fortun sudden and unexpect rise and fall 
thus each planet is judg accord to it natur and the aspect it throw to the moon or sun while the pg 66 planet in the 2nd hous are judg by their own natur and the aspect which they receiv 
inherit is shown by a bene�c planet in the 5th or 11th hous in good aspect to saturn but indirect inherit can be the result of saturn in good aspect to jupit from ani part of the figur 
legaci are shown by good planet or planet well aspect in the 8th hous or by jupit in good aspect to uranus from ani part of the heaven 
gain by marriag is shown by bene�c planet in the 8th hous becaus the 8th is 2nd from the 7th and the 7th hous rule over the partner 
the potenti of each horoscop is capabl of be increas by due attent to the sourc of gain as shown by the posit and aspect of the planet in various part of the heaven but chieﬂi by associ oneself with person whose horoscop are in harmoni with one’ own 
thus it happen that individu are lift to posit and aﬄuenc through their associ with person whose horoscop are in sympathi with their 
see chap 
xi 
of this section 
the sun and moon be in good aspect to one anoth will prevent disast or will alway provid a mean of restor of fortun becaus it is an index of general good fortun and continu support 
such person as have this aspect in their horoscop need never fear misfortun for if they should fall into disast in one place they will alway turn up in anoth with a complet adjust of their posit 
but when the sun and moon are in evil aspect and particular when the male�c planet are in elev in the heaven continu misfortun dog the footstep and though there be spell of good fortun they are brief and attend with pg 67 troubl 
the bene�c planet jupit venus and sun be well elev in the heaven that is to say in the 10th or 11th hous it is a sign of preponder good fortun 
but when the male�c are in elev the revers result happen 
the line of least resist 
it is a law in natur that the line of least resist is that of greatest progress 
the lightn ﬂash doe not come straight to earth but zigzag by the line of least resist 
the great river do not come by a direct cours to the ocean but by mani turn and backward reach becaus they follow the path of least resist 
when one come to take account of the year of human life that are spent in the vain endeavour to achiev the imposs the lesson of natur are worth recit 
but what is imposs to one man is facil to anoth and the greatest economi of eﬀort is therefor to be secur by proper regard to suitabl of occup and direct of effort 
the principl of astrolog enabl us to determin the line of action which at all time will be the most fruit of result and in the matter of moneymak the matter is decid in the follow manner that planet which has a trine or sextil aspect of the moon and is at the same time elev abov the male�c planet especi if it be itself assist by the good aspect of other planet receiv �rst consider 
the hous it is in will indic the sourc of bene�t but the sign it is in will show the mean through which it will come 
thus if uranus pg 68 should be in the midheaven in trine aspect to the moon and itself receiv a good aspect from either the sun jupit or venus it will indic gain through government bodi author and person of high rank 
if uranus should be in the sign cancer it would point to matter associ with the ocean marin aﬀair or those in which water is the element in chief employ as in marin engin ship dock build c but if uranus had been in the 11th hous and in the sign scorpio then the sourc of gain would be by mean of compani syndic and associ of a collect natur and the sign scorpio would show it to be connect with naval defenc becaus scorpio is a martial and wateri sign or the utilis of wast materi inﬂamm oil c or by system of drainag which repres the excretori system of a town 
by look chieﬂi to the natur of the planet concern and that of the sign it occupi a good artist will readili describ the particular line which is to be pursu 
but here as in everi other matter upon which judgment is made attent must be paid to the charact and disposit of the subject his aptitud and quali�c for it is obvious of littl use recommend literatur or the law to one whose sole capabl lie in unintellectu direct 
natur aptitud supplement by the necessari train are the first consider for without these success in ani direct is but ill assur 
pg 69 chapter vi the posit in life this is to be judg from the posit of the major of the planet but princip from the midheaven the planet therein and it aspect 
thus if you �nd the major of the planet rise that is to say in the 10th 11th 12th 1st 2nd and 3rd hous the subject will be a candid for respons ambiti of honour and posit and general independ 
if these or the major of them be well aspect he will becom a man of posit employ other or if a woman will hold an import posit in her sphere of life and be esteem in the social world 
if the degre on the midheaven receiv good aspect from the major planet the posit will be honour and secur 
venus or jupit or the sun well aspect in the midheaven denot a superior posit honour and distinct 
the same will result if these be rise 
when the major of the planet are abov the horizon even though they be not rise the subject will have respons thrust upon him even though he should not desir them 
if the major of these planet be well pg 70 aspect he will acquit himself credit and attain to honour 
it is alway fortun for the posit that there should be planet exact on the cusp of either the 2nd 3rd 6th 8th or 12th hous for then there will be everi opportun of secur fame and advanc in life 
but when ani of the male�c planet are found exact on or nearest to the meridian whether abov or below the horizon there will be loss of posit revers a sinist fame or disgrac 
the 10th hous repres the fame and honour of a person and the 4th hous repres the end of life and that which milit against the fame and honour 
therefor when there are good planet in these place the subject will meet with reward and honour commensur with his eﬀort but when evil planet occupi the meridian he will at best sustain his posit in life with great difficulti 
it is futil for ani one to suppos that the posit of a bene�c planet in the meridian of the horoscop will bring him to fame and elev him in the world irrespect of his own endeavour 
the planet oper on human aﬀair in term of human thought and action and that by �xed law never adventiti 
that “the god help those who help themselves� to the extent that natur law permit is a truth which astrolog fulli provid for 
fit and fortun are as caus and effect to one anoth in respect of planetari action in human life 
mani planet in cardin sign will dispos a man to seek fame and when the midheaven of the horoscop is well aspect or there be fortun planet therein he will attain it 
cardin sign on the angl of the pg 71 horoscop the meridian and horizon produc fame outlast death 
the same if either of the luminari be exact on the equinox 
venus in the midheaven give social elev and lift a person abov the sphere of birth 
good planet in the 11th show patronag 
but when the luminari are heavili aﬄict there will be an inconst fortun and mani revers so that posit gain will be lost again 
most of the planet under the horizon show success and posit in the latter part of life while if they be between the 4th and 7th cusp there will be advantag after marriag or by mean of partnership 
in judg of the mean by which the posit will be sustain respect must be had to the posit of those planet which are in good aspect to the midheaven or to bene�c planet in the midheaven and if none be so situat then those which hold bene�c aspect to either the sun or moon at birth must be taken and judgment made accord to the natur of the planet and the sign it occupi 
prefer should alway be given to that planet which has the strongest aspect for good 
thus if two planet were in trine that which is in elev should be prefer especi if it be strengthen by the good aspect of other planet 
pg 72 chapter vii the choic of occup the enorm wast of forc and time entail by the experiment trip upon which most young men embark at the outset of their career in life might be great reduc by a proper knowledg of individu aptitud in relat to circumst 
the averag boy cannot readili make up his mind as to what occup he will follow becaus he doe not know either enough of his own power or of the world in which he is call upon to use them 
parent are in the same diﬃculti 
they must need wait to see how a boy will shape out 
they studi his inclin to the best of their abil but without come to a de�nit conclus ani sooner than the boy himself 
given a fair educ such as may �t him for almost anyth but which specialis him for noth in particular he is put to some desk or bench and there left to his own resourc 
by a fortun chanc he may �nd himself suit to his post 
more frequent he is sever year in �nding out that he has miss his vocat that his inclin and his work are not in accord that he has misappli his energi for some time and that he has made a fals start 
fortun circumstanc at birth he may have been equip by higher educ pg 73 for some distinct profess to which he gain access after the payment of larg fee or premium 
the man has a strong dramat faculti and the stage claim him after all 
here is both wast of time and money 
astrolog as a reliabl key to charact and inclin deserv some recognit on the ground of social economi 
the inclin of the subject are judg from the posit of the major of the planet for if they should be found in the aerial sign gemini libra or aquarius the inclin will be toward mental occup especi scienc and literatur 
in �eri sign there is a predisposit to a more robust and activ life such as is aﬀord by militari servic travel prospect explor c in earthi sign the aptitud lie in the direct of agricultur experiment scienc survey deal in real estat broke c in wateri sign there is special inclin to pursuit connect with the water such as sailor watermen and other but frequent to other occup in which ﬂuid are predomin such as publican wine and spirit merchant chemist and oil merchant 
each sign has it special tendenc and the exact occup can often be decid therebi when regard is had to the planet in closest aspect to the sun or moon and the sign it occupi 
thus ari denot soldier and pioneer of movement taurus show dealer in real estat hous agent and broker gemini literari men and writer of all sort cancer sailor and publican leo actor and artist virgo cloth dealer and seller of confectioneri and bread libra valuer assay moneychang and pawnbrok scorpio naval sailor pg 74 chemist dealer in oil and spirit sagittarius explor divin lawyer capricornus polit agent and minist of the state aquarius electrician compani promot syndic and scienti�c research pisc dealer in �sh and sea produc warder and those connect with place of con�nement such as prison and hospit 
take therefor the domin planet and the sign that hold the major of the planet the line along which the subject will make the most progress in the world and acquit himself most success may be readili determin 
no person will make a good soldier who has not mar as a domin planet nor will he succeed with the public if the moon be not elev and well aspect nor becom a success artist musician or poet if venus be not conspicu in the horoscop 
general the inclin is deriv from a consider of the domin planet and the degre of success attend upon the occup is judg from the aspect which that planet throw to the sun or moon and there can be no great advantag from follow an inclin which doe not promis some measur of success as is the case when the domin planet is in evil aspect to the luminari 
thus it happen that some men follow unpro�t call their judgment be domin by an inclin advers to their natur welfar 
yet never was good work done in the world without a strong inclin and consider enthusiasm and heaven make it own slave it martyr and it scapegoat 
and alway the follow of an inclin mean the pg 75 sacri�c of some of the bene�t of life 
“take what thou wilt but pay the price� is the divin mandat accord to emerson 
but unquestion the scienc which enabl a man to choos the line of least resist which prevent a youth of intellectu tendenc from wast the best year of his life in drudgeri at the desk or bench is worth a littl studi 
“hitch your waggon to a star� is good advic if onli we hitch it to the right one 
pg 76 chapter viii marriag circumst the question as to how when and where marriag will take place is an allabsorb one to the major of men and women and no less import than interest 
astrolog has made it possibl to answer these question categor and with particular precis and veriti 
the condit of connubi life are judg in a male horoscop from the condit of the moon and venus and in a femal horoscop from that of the sun and mar 
the planet to which the luminari �rst form an aspect after birth that which it “applies� to denot the marriag partner 
if the aspect be good there will be agreement and the choic of a partner will be fortun 
but if the aspect be evil there will be troubl after marriag 
the natur of the planet to which the luminari form it aspect after birth ought also to be consid for if it be that the luminari appli by a good aspect to a bene�c planet or to one that is wellplac and aspect then there will be consider happi and fortun in marriag 
on the other hand if both the aspect and the planet be evil—a if the moon were appli to the opposit of saturn or uranus or mars— pg 77 then the fate in marriag will be extrem unhappi and disagr will be frequent and even perman 
when the aspect and the natur of the planet are at varianc as when the moon has a good aspect to saturn or a bad aspect to jupit there will be a mingl fortun of good and ill in marriag 
there is no better sign of happi and harmoni in marriag than a good aspect between the sun and moon 
moreov it may happen that the moon appli by good aspect to a planet after birth and that there is at the same time a male�c bodi in the 7th hous 
this indic that there will be agreement in the connubi life but that bereav will soon follow 
when the moon appli to neptun there will be some peculiar or touch of genius in the partner accord as neptun may be aspect 
uranus show eccentr and sometim wil 
saturn show steadi industri or jealousi and cold 
jupit indic a good natur bounti and honest but may be given to excess and extravag 
mar induc industri and practic but it give a strong temper and consider independ 
the sun show digniti and loyalti but may indic ostent and foolish pride 
venus denot peac and a genial re�n natur but it pervers bring indiﬀer neglect and disorderli 
mercuri denot an activ and energet natur but may produc a busybodi and meddler 
everyth depend on the aspect which the signi�c luminari throw to the planet it appli to for if the aspect be good it will indic the better qualiti of that planet but if evil then there is frequent the unfortun consequ of choos a partner in whom the pervert qualiti of the planet are predomin 
pg 78 good planet in the 7th hous indic a good partner but when at the same time the aspect of the luminari is evil it will denot a good marriag follow by bereav 
marriag to a widow or widow occur when mar and saturn are the planet concern in the indic as if mar be in the 7th hous and in aspect to saturn or if the moon appli to mar when aspect by saturn or when one of them is in the 5th hous and the other in the 7th 
love aﬀair befor marriag are indic by the 5th hous the planet therein and their aspect and in a general sens by venus in a male horoscop and mar in a femal horoscop 
thus if venus or mar be aﬄict by saturn or uranus there will be disappoint in the earli aﬀect 
uranus in aspect to venus give romant attach and much inﬂuenc over the other sex 
neptun in aspect show ideal and when aﬄict venus it produc chao and entangl danger of seduct 
mar afflict venus give ardour and impuls 
more than one marriag is indic when the luminari is in aspect to more than one planet in a doublebodi signeg gemini sagittarius or pisc 
or if the luminari itself be in a doubl sign and in aspect to ani planet other than one which may be in the 7th hous 
also a doubl sign be on the cusp of the 7th hous and the luminari in a fruit sign cancer scorpio or pisc or in aspect to planet in those sign 
all these are sign of more than pg 79 one marriag dure life 
sign of separ or divorc are as follow the luminari appli to the ill aspect of a male�c planet venus aﬄict and uranus in the 7th hous or aﬄict the moon or venus 
in femal horoscop chang the signif take the sun and mar instead of the moon and venus and judg the same 
where more than one marriag is shown the ruler of the 7th hous denot the �rst partner and the planet rule the sign it occupi is call it “dispositor� or “displacer� this dispositor repres the second partner 
the planet to which the signi�c luminari appli is that which is taken to describ the partner accord to the sign it is in 
but if this planet be retrograd ie go backward in the zodiac by appar motion then it onli repres an attach which will be broken oﬀ 
it dispositor then becom the signi�c of the partner 
but the ruler of the 7th hous is taken for the condit and fortun of the partner and if it be aﬄict or bad place and weak in the horoscop then the marriag will be illassort unfortun and full of dissatisfact 
the contrari is the case when the signific planet is well place and aspect 
the place or circumst under which the partner will be met may be known from the sign and hous occupi by the planet to which the luminari �rst appli after birth 
thus if it be in the 11th hous the partner will be met among friend at the hous of a friend or introduc by a friend 
if in the 3rd hous then on a short pg 80 journey or in correspond in the 5th at a place of amus in the 10th in the cours of busi and so on judgment be made accord to the place and circumst rule by the hous occupi by the planet 
pg 81 chapter ix indic of progeni the 5th hous the planet therein and the posit and aspect of the moon have to be consid in this matter 
if the 5th hous be occupi by bene�c planet or planet well aspect by other then the progeni will be a sourc of satisfact and credit to the subject and will be rear to matur 
but the contrari is the case when the 5th hous is occupi by malef planet and such as may be heavili afflict 
the moon repres the tendenc in the male and the capac in the femal and when well aspect or free from evil aspect and well place then there will be good fortun in connect with the progeni 
when uranus aﬄict a planet in the 5th hous there will be some prematur birth and general it will be observ that when planet are oppos from the 11th and 5th hous or male�c planet occupi those hous there is troubl through the progeni and usual the loss of one or more dure infanc is to be fear 
as to the number of children no empir rule exist for the judgment of this matter which necessarili is a pg 82 diﬃcult one owe to the fact that we have no mean of compar the horoscop of man and wife but the natur of the sign on the cusp of the 5th hous is usual to be depend upon for an approxim 
thus ari leo and capricornus give small famili 
taurus cancer virgo scorpio and pisc give larg famili and the other sign yield a moder famili 
when the moon is strong angular and not aﬄict the number is increas 
twin are born from doublebodi sign occupi the cusp of the 5th hous or planet in the 5th in a doublebodi sign 
the condit of each child is known in a general manner from the altern hous commenc with the 5th 
thus the �rst child is in a male horoscop rule by the 5th hous and planet therein the second child by the 7th hous the third by the 9th hous and so on 
in a femal horoscop the �rst child is rule by the 4th hous the second by the 6th hous and so on 
thus if it be found that there is probabl of loss of some of the progeni the children most liabl to aﬄict may be known by this method for the hous which contain the male�c planet or the aﬄict planet correspond to the afflict progeni 
illustri children are born to the subject when the ruler of the 5th hous is in elev and well aspect and in a congeni sign 
but if the ruler of the 5th hous be bad place and aspect and in a sign of debil ie opposit to one over which it rule then the progeni are illequip for the battl of life either mental or moral 
the particular qualiti and fortun of the progeni can onli be known from their individu horoscop 
pg 83 when male�c planet hold the 12th hous in a femal horoscop there will be danger in con�nement and the same happen if either of the luminari but particular the moon be afflict in the 5th hous 
pg 84 chapter x voyag and journey the indic of short journey inland and around the coast are to be judg from the 3rd hous and the planet therein 
if a movabl sign be on the cusp of the 3rd hous or planet in a movabl sign occupi the 3rd hous then there will be much travel and mani short journey to and fro 
the aspect to these planet in the 3rd will indic whether such journey will be main success or not 
when there are no aspect to the planet or planet in the 3rd hous the fortun of short journey is to be judg from the natur of the planet in the 3rd as if jupit they will be fortun and lucrat but if saturn unfortun and subject to mani hindranc and delay 
when male�c planet are aﬄict in the 3rd hous or male�c planet in the 3rd throw evil aspect to the sun or moon then there will be danger and accid 
wateri sign on the cusp of the 3rd hous or planet in wateri sign in the 3rd indic cruis and yacht short journey by water around the coast 
if the moon be in good aspect to these planet then there will be safeti in passag but if aﬄict by the planet in the 3rd there will be danger of collis capsiz c pg 85 accord to the natur of the planet in the 3rd hous 
long voyag are to be judg in exact similar manner from the 9th hous the planet therein and their aspect 
the 4th hous indic the place of birth and if this hous hold a bene�c planet or either the sun or moon well aspect then there is fortun in the place of birth and journey should onli be undertaken when they are without doubt fortun in their issu and admit of a return to the nativ place 
when howev the 4th hous is occupi by evil planet or planet heavili aﬄict it will be advis to remov from the place of birth and seek fortun in more propiti local 
in this matter the choic is made by refer to that planet which hold the greatest power for good in the horoscop of birth and the quarter of the heaven which it occupi will indic the direct as from the place of birth to which the subject should repair 
thus if between the east horizon and the meridian southeast between the meridian and the west horizon southwest and so of the rest 
the point of the compass follow the cardin point of the heaven the midheaven be south the nadir north the ascend east and the descend west 
if a male�c planet is rise or set at birth it is advis to �x the place of resid so much to the eastward of the birthplac as will suﬃc to bring the male�c planet out of the angl of the horoscop 
the same if male�c planet occupi the 10th or 4th hous 
on the contrari if bene�c planet are in the 3rd and 9th hous the subject should pg 86 move westward so as to bring the benef influenc into the 10th and 4th hous 
when bene�c planet or planet well aspect occupi the angl of the �gure at birth the subject should not travel far nor resid long away from the place of birth 
indic of mani voyag are as follow mani planet in wateri sign cancer scorpio and pisc and also in the sign virgo 
when the major of the planet are in cardin and ﬂex sign ari gemini cancer virgo libra sagittarius capricornus and pisc there will be mani chang and journey 
also if the sun moon mar and mercuri are in either the 3rd 9th 12th or 6th hous there will be mani journey and long explor in foreign countri 
when planet are aﬄict in wateri sign there will be danger in voyag and if the moon or sun be aﬄict in virgo there will be submers due to wreck 
also when there are planet especi male�c in scorpio leo taurus and aquarius aﬄict by the aspect of other planet or themselv afflict the sun or moon then there is danger of drown 
when the sign of voyag are propiti and especi when the indic in the 4th hous are not so then remov from the place of birth to some other perman centr of activ will be advis 
but when good planet or planet well aspect are either rise or in the 4th hous the subject should remain in his nativ place and in the end his patienc will be justifi 
pg 87 chapter xi of friend and enemi the general harmoni of the horoscop consist in the posit and aspect of the planet and their relat with the luminari 
when this is conspicu there will be mani friend and support and the associ of the subject will be pleasant and pro�tabl 
but when the horoscop is fraught with evil aspect and angular posit of the malef there will be much strife and mani enmiti 
in a particular sens the friend and associ of the subject are to be known from the 11th hous and the planet therein 
for if there be a bene�c planet in the 11th especi if in good aspect to either of the luminari there will be mani friend and adher

saturn in the 7th or 12th show long feud and implac enmiti

will show that the sun is in aquarius 13 on the 1st and 2nd februari 
henc it would be unfortun for the subject to serv ani man who was born between the 28th januari and the 3rd februari in ani year 
also if uranus were in leo 23 in the 7th hous he should not go into partnership or marriag with anybodi born on or near the 15th august in ani year 
take now the place of the bene�c planet and also the place of the moon and �nd the correspond solar date for these will be the birth date of such person as should be cultiv and drawn into close associ for mutual benefit 
observ also the trine and sextil of the bene�c planet and of the moon and the squar and opposi tion of pg 89 the malef for these will oper in a minor degre in a similar manner as alreadi indic 
a comparison of the horoscop of person whether king or plebeian with those of other who have wrought great good or evil in their live will immedi establish this observ 
inde there is noth more depend in the whole rang of scienti�c observ than this sympathi and antipathi of horoscop and their correspond result 
it is an argument for the claim of it advoc that astrolog should be regard in the light of a scienc for if the planet act not at all upon the disposit and tendenc of men their squar and opposit in two separ horoscop would have no signi�c 
let those who are unhappili mate compar their horoscop and they will �nd the sign of discord to which refer has been made abov 
on the other hand let ani man who has been lift to wealth fame or posit by the patronag of anoth compar his horoscop with that of his benefactor and it will be found that the bene�c planet in the latter hold the place of the sun moon midheaven or ascend in his own 
this frequent account for the fact that men with compar unfortun horoscop are sometim found in posit of inﬂuenc and in the enjoy of consider fortun 
the complex fabric of life has it warp and woof wherein mani colour thread are woven togeth for the complet of the grand design and the great loom of life has it wheel within wheel which onli the great arti�c can understand and regul 
we here below subject all of interplanetari action must content ourselv with the design as reveal to us in the histori of mankind or we pg 90 must seek to understand the purpos of life it motif the complex law which oper to bring about the unfold of the great plan and thenc to prognost that which hereaft shall be reveal to the commonplac observ 
pg 91 chapter xii the end of life the end of life is judg from the planet occupi the 8th and 4th hous for the 8th denot death and the 4th denot the �nal restingplac of man 
when bene�c planet or the luminari well aspect occupi these hous you may judg that the end will be peac normal and that death will take place in the midst of congeni and even except agreeabl surround 
when howev the male�c planet hold these hous or aﬄict the luminari therein you may judg greater stress and privat 
uranus in the 8th hous denot a sudden death and the same result is observ when the luminari therein are aﬄict by uranus 
neptun in the 8th denot danger of tranc coma and simul death and when this posit is observ it is necessari that all the sign of morti�c should be present befor inter is eﬀect 
saturn produc death by privat and obstruct by chill and cold 
mar induc death by fever and inflammatori action and frequent by h�morrhag 
planet in fix sign in the 8th hous show death from heart or throat aﬀect aﬀect of the excretori pg 92 pg 94 section iv the star in their cours chapter i the timemeasur the planet in their motion after birth come into certain relat with the planet in the horoscop of birth and also form aspect among themselv owe to the divers of their motion in the zodiac 
in astrolog scienc there are two separ mean of calcul the time of event but both method consist of bring the bodi of one planet to the bodi or aspect of anoth which process is call “directing� and the arc describ by the move bodi is call an “arc of direction� the �rst of these method is the discoveri of claudius ptolemi the famous mathematician and geograph the author of the syntaxi as set forth in his work the tetrabiblo or four book on the inﬂuenc of the star 
this method had the support and con�rmat of the great kepler 
it has respect to the rise set and pg 95 meridian passag of the planet after birth wherebi they are brought to the place or aspect of the planet in the radix the root which is the horoscop of birth 
the limit and natur of this work do not permit of a thorough exposit of this method which entail some littl knowledg of spheric trigonometri but the reader who desir to perfect himself therein is refer to the author’ work entitl “prognost astronomy� a facil applic of the method is here given by which ani one may by the aid of the tabl of hous make certain of the more import calcul by rule of thumb and predict thenc the time of remark event 
the principl involv is this the number of degre which pass over the meridian between the moment of birth and the rise or culmin of a planet will equal the number of year which must elaps from birth until the influenc of that planet becom domin 
thus if jupit at birth is come to the meridian that is to say if it be in the 10th 11th or 12th hous count the number of degre between the meridian and jupit and in so mani year from the time of birth there will be an access of good fortun 
similar if saturn or other of the male�c planet be come to the meridian the number of degre between it and the midheaven will indic the age at which troubl will abound 
also when the planet have pass the meridian the measur is made in the same way by bring the midheaven to the place of the planet count the degre between the planet and midheaven for the number of year at which it will oper 
but the same and other planet may be direct to the horizon by take the tabl of hous for the latitud of pg 96 the birthplac sect 
i chap 
iii 
and �nding therein under the column mark “ascen� ascend the longitud held by ani of the planet 
observ then what degre is on the midheaven in the column mark 10 10th hous and count the number of degre between this midheaven and the midheaven at birth 
the result will give the age at which the effect of such planet will be experienc 
thus for a person born in or near liverpool or in the same latitud suppos the midheaven at birth to be in scorpio 0 and saturn to be in the 2nd hous in aquarius 8 degre 
i wish to bring saturn to the horizon 
in the tabl of hous i �nd that aquarius 8 is on the ascend when sagittarius 9 is on the midheaven and i therefor count from scorpio 0 to sagittarius 9 
this give the age of 39 year and as saturn is in the 2nd hous at birth i say that at 39 year of age the subject would experi �nancial disast and becaus saturn come then to the ascend i also say there would be serious ill and depress of spirit 
when planet are set at birth they are brought to the opposit of the ascend in a similar manner onli the opposit point of the zodiac must be found in the tabl under the ascend 
thus if mar were in the 7th hous at birth in the 11th degre of cancer i �nd the opposit point capricornus 11 under the column of the ascend and i note that scorpio 19 is then on the midheaven so that from scorpio 0 to scorpio 19 give 19 year at which age the subject would have a serious ill due to inﬂammatori action in the stomach and pg 97 probabl produc by overwork and worri as indic by the sign cancer and the planet mar or if there be indic of an accid then an accid by scald with hot water or acid would be predict 
planet are brought to the opposit of the midheaven by count the degre which interven between the longitud on the lower meridian at birth and that held by the planet 
in all such direct the conjunct of bene�c planet are advantag when direct to the midheaven or ascend and the conjunct of the male�c are indic of period of bad fortun 
the opposit are uniform evil whether the planet involv in the direct be a benef or malef 
sect

these are the direct of the planet to the two signi�c the midheaven and ascend 
the midheaven appertain to honour and credit while the ascend has relat to the person and bodili welfar and the general fortun 
to direct the midheaven or ascend to the other aspect of the planet such as the sextil trine semisquar or squar it is onli necessari to note the degre in which these aspect fall and bring them to the midheaven or ascend as if the bodi of the planet were itself there and in the manner alreadi indic 
the sun is direct after birth by it motion in the zodiac which can be found in the ephemeri for the year of birth and the aspect it form to the planet in the horoscop and in the daili progress should be tabul 
in most ephemerid they are alreadi calcul so that the labour is consider lighten 
each day after birth pg 98 will repres one year of life the mean motion of the sun be about 1 degre per day 
all that is necessari therefor is to count the number of day from birth to the date when the sun form an aspect and that will give the age at which the planet aspect will produc it effect 
as the sun goe through the zodiac the other bodi make progress along with it in which cours they form aspect to the midheaven ascend the sun and moon in the horoscop of birth 
these are call “secondary� direct and in connect with the sun’ aspect after birth constitut the system in use among the arabian astrolog 
minor period of good and bad fortun subsidiari to the abov period inﬂuenc are taken from the moon’ progress after birth in which one day equal one year of life and two hour equal one month 
these direct of the moon aﬀord a month prognosi of the cours of event and are use in the conduct of minor aﬀair in life 
when they are contrari to the general trend and import of the period direct made to the midheaven ascend and sun they act indiﬀer and frequent produc onli pass bene�t or annoy but when they are in agreement with the primari direct cite abov then they accentu and de�n the natur and time of event 
as if the primari be good and the lunar direct evil then there will be a predomin of good fortun with some current disturb but both be good there will be abund success and satisfact while if the primari be evil and the lunar direct good the latter will serv onli to pg 99 moder the effect for the time be of the primari evil indic 
an intellig apercu of the principl of direct will great enhanc the valu of ani prognost made from the horoscop of birth as it will enabl the student to select those period in the life when the eﬀect due to ani planet are most like to eventu 
thus if saturn be in the 2nd hous at birth it may be said that there would follow some period of great �nancial stress and the rise of saturn by direct after birth would show the time when one at all event of such period would be experienc 
and here is the great fact upon which astrolog the world over are prepar to stand or fall 
if the planet have no eﬀect in the live of men their direct to the angl of the horoscop can have no eﬀect but never was it found that a man had evil fortun at the period when the planet jupit was direct to the midheaven or ascend or anyth but bad fortun when saturn was similar direct 
the fact is there and we cannot get away from it 
the onli question is as to how far we can intellig carri our investig beyond that point and intellig convey our discoveri to the world by their applic to the aﬀair of daili life 
the reader may judg for himself from a perus of these page 
the direct be calcul and tabul in order of their occurr the time and general natur of the inﬂuenc oper in success period of the life will stand reveal 
the particular natur of the event indic by the sever direct may be known from a the hous in which the direct planet is situat b pg 100 the sign it occupi and c the aspect it form consid in relat to the natur of the planet 
for exampl if uranus at birth were in the 9th hous and the sign gemini it direct to the midheaven would be the index of litig in connect with write public or mean of transit becaus the 9th hous among other thing has relat to litig and legal aﬀair and gemini the 3rd hous sign to communic write c while uranus denot sudden and unexpect event ruptur alien and complex 
so if saturn were in the 6th hous in the sign aquarius it direct to the opposit of the ascend would indic chill to the blood anemia c constitut a serious ill with probabl of low fever becaus the 6th hous rule sick and aquarius rule the blood while saturn is the caus of chill pauciti and impedi 
thus the time and natur of event may be known with great certainti 
pg 101 chapter ii the effect of transit among the number of import indic to which astrolog refer in make a forecast of concurr event there are the transit of the planet over the place of the signi�c at birth the posit of eclips and those of the lunat 
the �rst of these chronocr depend upon the revolut of the planet in their orbit 
each planet has a period in which it complet it revolut in the heaven in the cours of which it pass the place of the sun moon midheaven and ascend of the horoscop 
this passag over the radic signi�c is technic term it “transit� and it will be found that such transit aﬀord a veri precis and reliabl sourc of prognost for the time of a planet’ transit is known in advanc of it occurr see sect 
ii chap 
iv 
and the eﬀect of such transit are in exact term of the natur of the planet concern 
it is onli necessari to add that the midheaven and the sun have relat to the posit and honour of the subject while the moon and ascend have relat to the person health and general fortun 
the sun and midheaven also signifi pg 102 the father and the moon has general signi�c of the mother 
venus signi� domest and love aﬀair the aﬀect and sentiment while mercuri signi� the mental disposit 
so uranus in transit over the place of venus will give a love aﬀair a romant attach 
mar over the place of venus will engend passion love 
saturn over venus will give disappoint or bereav and neptun thereov will bring entangl and complic with danger of be led astray 
saturn over mercuri will produc melancholi and mani error of judgment 
mar over the same planet will excit the mind and dispos to impuls and unreason anger quarrel and disput 
uranus over mercuri will render the mind wayward and headstrong dispos to errat cours and egotist method 
neptun pass the place of mercuri produc deceit treacheri and apprehens of impend evil a sens of espionag and ambush 
it involv the mind in tortuous and complic scheme and dispos to secreci and wari 
the transit of the major planet are of chief signi�c and their eﬀect are render more weighti and last when at the time of transit they are retrograd in the zodiac while their stationari posit on the place of the signif have almost the same power as primari direct 
of eclips 
an eclips of the sun or moon fall on the place of ani signi�c in the horoscop of birth is of a sinist import and cannot be too serious consid 
fall on the ascend or the moon they aﬀect the health and pg 103 general fortun veri serious and onli a seri of subsequ good direct can avail to restor the subject to his normal condit 
on the midheaven or the sun the honour and fortun may both be aﬀect and in the same serious degre 
the eclips fall on the place of the other planet will produc eﬀect in accord with the natur of those planet and the hous they occupi 
to have ani appreci eﬀect the eclips must be within two degre of ani of the radic posit or of their opposit aspect 
of lunat 
the lunat recur in the same part of the eclipt everi nineteen year 
consid in relat to the current indic they aﬀord the mean of a month forecast of event 
thus if the lunat for the month fall on the place of jupit in the horoscop of birth it will produc good eﬀect in that depart of life which is govern by the hous in which jupit is situat as if in the 11th through friend in the 4th through properti or rental in the 6th through servant and health in the 8th through a financi colleagu c the eﬀect of lunat are subsidiari to the current lunar direct and these in turn are subsidiari to the transit and the transit to the primari direct 
by this it is not meant that they are inop nor that they fail to indic the event of the month but their power and degre of inﬂuenc is subject to the greater inﬂuenc of superior caus 
and as a general observ it may be aﬃrm that the less frequent ani celesti posit occur in a horoscop the greater is it inﬂuenc 
this fact give to primari direct their pg 104 great inﬂuenc in the life for they can onli occur onc in a lifetim and for the same reason eclips have a major signi�c for the same eclips onli recur after an interv of 649 year 
the transit of neptun of uranus of saturn and jupit and mar follow in their order of frequenc 
neptun has a revolut of about 165 year uranus 84 year saturn 30 year jupit 12 year and mar 1� year 
major eﬀect must not therefor be refer to inferior caus and minor eﬀect must not be refer to superior caus

read what you see not what you imagin should be the destini of an individu 
if you are in complet ignor of his person posit and environ so much the better 
if you follow care the various rule which are contain in this book you may at �rst make some error of judgment but as you becom familiar with the task even these error will becom few and far between and in the end the languag of the horoscop will becom so intellig and clear that it will interpret itself and the whole trend and potenti for good or ill of ani birth�gur will forc itself upon you in just the same way as when a man walk into your presenc with his charact clear stamp upon his face so that you have onli to look and know 
have becom pro�cient in the judgment of birth�gur you will do well to proceed to a closer studi of the mathemat of astrolog make yourself pro�cient in the various method of direct so that you may at ani pg 107 time refin upon your general prognost and make predict which are clear sharp and to the point 
undoubt there is a modicum of intuit percept at work in the judgment of ani horoscop which will enabl you to seiz upon the small detail and exact point of ani matter and this perhap constitut the whole diﬀer between the rule of thumb worker and the inspir reason of the intuit worker 
the one exhaust the book and the other embellish them 
it is so with scienc in everi depart 
the book will take you up to a certain point of pro�cienc and a strict regard for the formul� will keep you within the bound of safeti 
but if you are ever to make a discoveri or becom a recognis expon of ani scienc you must be natur gift with what is call the “scienti�c imagination� anoth name for intuit 
but at no point doe true intuit part compani with exact reason 
there is no lesion 
the one is an extens of the other 
it is the higher reason which argu from the known to the unknown 
and the astrolog is in this respect as the poet “born not made� but a moment’ reﬂect will suﬃc to convinc you that the more facil you may becom with the booklearn and techniqu of astrolog the more you will leav the intuit free to act 
when a lad is struggl with his multipl tabl his appreci of the binomi theorem or the diﬀerenti calculus cannot be said to amount to much

it is believ that the revis and enlarg of the present work will render it even more popular than hitherto with beginn 
the practic use of astrolog are daili more and more recogn and appreci and although some of the higher and later develop of astrolog in it relat to everyday problem have necessarili been withheld from these page yet it is to be hope that so much as is here present of an abstrus and recondit scienc will enabl the student to pursu the subject with increas assur and satisfact in which case doubtless he will readili discov for himself and without ani special point on my part that astrolog is primarili and final a practic and use studi 
there are of cours mani aspect of this fascin subject which �nd no place in this small work which deal sole with genethliac astrolog or the doctrin of nativ 
yet if it be true as i think to be the case that “the proper studi for mankind is man� then undoubt we are right in select this phase of astrolog scienc as that to which the student should first devot himself 
when we have thorough arriv at an understand of the complex natur of human charact and the primari caus of varieti in express when we have seen for ourselv how the manycolour dome of life pg 6 overarch us of this sublunari world with it kaleidoscop interplay of forc we shall be to some extent better equip not onli to deal with charact as we �nd it but also to direct the forc of the human mind along channel which lead to the preserv of our social economi and that not by ani restrict measur or harm suppress of natur passion and power but by convers of them into form that are conserv and use 
to appli oneself to the special of inher faculti to �nd the line of least resist and to discov the measur of one’ own soul in the univers and the limit to which ambit can safe aspir these are thing necessari to be known and thing that astrolog make clear to the mind in the veri earliest stage of our studi 
and apart from the scienti�c veriti to which the scienc of planetari inﬂuenc direct us there are other not less import and fascin truth of a pure philosoph natur to which it inevit impel the mind and which cannot fail to exercis a tremend inﬂuenc in the shape of our thought in regard to the purpos of life 
it place the thought student in an entir new posit with regard to mani of the deeper problem of exist and it is certain the fact that to those who newli come to it studi astrolog is a revel an enlighten and a convict from which there is no possibl or desir escap 
sephari 
pg 7 astrolog pg 9 introduct from the earliest age of the world’ histori the subject of astrolog has excit the interest of and exercis a great inﬂuenc over the mind of a certain order of think men 
the scienc has never been univers in it accept though it is safe to say that with it countless adher in the east and the everincreas number of it advoc in the west there is no faith which has a more univers applic than the belief in the inﬂuenc of the heaven bodi over the destini of human be 
it is not possibl within the limit of a small handbook such as this to adequ consid the philosoph paradox which make of freewil in man a “necess in play� but it is obvious that the concept is not altogeth unscienti�c see that it is customari to speak of the “free path of vibration� in chemic atom while at the same time it is known that these atom have their restrict characterist mode of motion c and are all subject to the general law control the bodi of which they form integr part 
let it suﬃc that if we can trace an actual connected between the disposit of the heaven bodi at the moment of a birth and the known life and charact of the individu pg 10 then born and an exact correspond between the cours of event in that life with the chang occur in the heaven subsequ to the moment of birth we shall do well to accept the fact for what it is worth and arrang our philosoph notion accord 
as far back as the year bc 
2154 we �nd mention of the great import attach to the celesti phenomena in the mind of chines ruler 
it is record in the histor classic of china that at that time the astrolog hi and ho neglect their duti so that when on the 10th of octob there was a great eclips of the sun at peke between seven and nine o’clock in the morn the peopl were wholli unprepar for it and “ran about here and there in the utmost consternation� for this oﬀenc hi and ho were depriv of their oﬃc their estat were con�scat and they were driven from the kingdom 
among the hindus we have the classic writer garga parashara and mihira togeth with their legion of comment 
the assyrian record are full of astrolog allus regard the inﬂuenc of planetari conjunct and stellar posit 
the greek mytholog is noth but a vast system of cosmograph astrolog and there is no other histori in it than what you may read in the constel of the heaven and the correspond evolut of the human race 
aristotl made it a part of his philosophi 
hipparchus hippocr thale galenius and other subscrib an intellig belief in it principl 
to claudius ptolemi howev we are indebt for the �rst concis and scienti�c statement of it principl and practic so far as europ is concern 
he wrote the tetrabiblo or pg 11 four book and laid the foundat of a true astrolog scienc 
julius firmicus con�rm ptolemi and enlarg upon his observ 
the subsequ discoveri of the planet uranus and neptun by herschel and adam widen the �eld of research and gave to later astrolog the clue to much that hitherto had been imperfect understood 
not that these discoveri overturn the whole system of astrolog as some have imagin and foolish state or that they negativ the conclus drawn from the observ eﬀect of the seven ancient known bodi of the solar system but it becam possibl after a laps of time to �ll in the blank space and to account for certain event which had not been trace to the action of ani of the alreadi known planet 
the discoveri of argon did not destroy our conclus regard the natur and characterist of oxygen or hydrogen or nitrogen nor give an entir new mean to the word “atmosphere� if even so mani as seven new planet should be discov there would yet not be a singl paragraph of this book which would need revis 
what is known regard planetari action in human life is known with great certainti and the eﬀect of one planet can never be confound with those of anoth 
incomplet as it must need be it is yet a verit scienc both as to it principl and practic 
it claim for itself a place among the scienc for the sole reason that it is capabl of mathemat demonstr and deal onli with the observ posit and motion of the heaven bodi and the man who hold to the principia of newton the solidar of the solar system the interact of the planetari bodi and their consequ electrostat eﬀect upon the earth cannot while pg 12 subject to the air he breath deni the foundat principl of astrolog 
the applic of these principl to the fact of everyday life is sole a matter of prolong research and tabul upon an elabor scale which has been go on for thousand of year in all part of the world so that all the reader has to do is to make his own horoscop and put the scienc to the test of true or fals 
the present writer is in a posit to know that the studi of astrolog at the present day is no less sincer than wide spread but few care to let their studi be known for as prof f max m�ller recent said “so great is the ignor which confound a scienc requir the highest educ with that of the ordinari gipsi fortuneteller� that to which the great kepler was compel “bi his unfail experi of the cours of event in harmoni with the chang take place in the heavens� to subscrib “an unwil belief� the scienc which was practis and advoc by tycho brahe under all assault of fortun and advers opinion the art that arrest the attent of the young newton and set him ponder upon the problem of forc and matter which fascin the mind of such men as franci bacon archbishop usher haley sir georg witchel flamstead and a host of other is today the favourit theme of thousand of intellig mind and bid fair to becom a subject of popular inquiri 
it is believ that the present work will be of consider assist to those who serious contempl an initi studi of the scienc of horoscopi and although it by no mean exhaust what is known on the subject yet it will be found accur and reliabl as far as it goe and will enabl ani one of ordinari intellig to test pg 13 the claim of astrolog for himself 
this is as much as can be expect in the limit of a small handbook 
the literatur of the subject is consider and the present writer onli take credit to himself so far as his own wide experi and practic have enabl him to present the subject in a simpl and brief manner

137 pg 17 pg 108 chapter iv how to becom a success astrolog i take it that nobodi nowaday can aﬀord to fritter away time in the studi of subject which are not like to becom a sourc of bene�t to himself and other 
if there be such peopl among my reader which i consid unlik i may dismiss them oﬀhand with the remark that they will never becom success astrolog for the �rst word of practic astrolog is util 
if the scienc had not it practic applic to the aﬀair of everyday life if it principl contain no word of assur and hope for the myriad toiler of this world no word of admonit for the selfindulg parasit of modern social life if in short it did not make for the better of human life and thought it would never have attract the attent of aristotl cicero galen claudius ptolemi thale and other of the old world and such men as bacon cardan archbishop usher naibod mercat ashmol kenelm digbi sir christoph heydon dryden dr john butler sir georg wharton vincent wing georg witchel tycho brahe kepler and flamstead of more recent biographi 
inde in whatev age or countri we may elect to make our inquiri concern astrolog there are to be found a host pg 109 of intellig and even illustri advoc in everi depart of life and learn 
suﬃc it to say that the modern student of this most ancient of all scienc is at all time in veri good compani 
let it �rst be understood that there is an object to be attain in the studi of astrolog and that the pursuit of it in the grati�c of an idl curios alon will inevit entail the wast of time which invari attach to idl of all descript and we may then pro�tabl consid whether or not the subject is worth the labour which it will demand from the man who has someth to do in the world and littl enough time in which to do it 
these are stress time and we have to be econom in our eﬀort 
we have strength enough to carri us through but neither strength enough to thresh the wind nor time enough to fish in puddl 
what then doe astrolog offer to the patient worker the man who would becom a success astrolog 
first and foremost it will enabl him to gain an insight into individu motiv and charact which no other scienc can possibl aﬀord 
it will enabl him to know himself his own strength and weak and so �t him to deal harmoni and just with other 
it will enhanc his opportun to the extent that he is abl to forese and make use of all bene�c inﬂuenc oper through his own environ 
it will give him time warn of his approach to the quicksand and pitfal which occur in his passag through life 
he will discern his special pg 110 physic weak and the time of his predisposit to sick the natur thereof and the precaut which are necessari 
he will know whom to cultiv and whom to avoid and in select a partner in busi or a wife for his home he will be guid by a foreknowledg of evil to be avoid and of good thing to be gain 
he will choos his path in life with the con�denc that it is for him the line of least resist and therefor that of greatest progress 
he will not becom obsess by ambit beyond his power to achiev 
he will learn the power of adapt to environ and therebi eﬀect his work in the world with the least possibl friction and wast of forc 
he will know when to make provis against sick accid and death 
he will not invest capit where interest is not to be gain 
he will see the end from the begin 
it may not make him a brilliant success in the world but it will assur save him from be a failur 
he will �nd caus for inexplic thing and his mind will rest content in the knowledg hat while he is work out the highest potenti of his own horoscop the major problem and intricaci of life are not of his make or need of his solv 
and �nalli when his time come to “shuﬄ oﬀ this mortal coil� he will be prepar and will know that it is the will of heaven express and determin from the moment of his birth 
right employ astrolog cannot fail to improv the man who make of it a serious studi �tting him to be of greater use to other and of higher servic to the race at larg 
but to becom a success astrolog he must studi patient for sever year test each statement that is pg 111 made in the book by refer to his own and sever other horoscop 
he must be abl to erect a �gure of the heaven with mathemat accuraci for ani given time and place work out direct by the use of the sphere or trigonometr tabl and have a compet knowledg of the motion and period of the various planetari bodi 
when thus satis� in his own mind that astrolog is a depend scienc and that he is capabl of demonstr it under test condit he must be generous in the use of it 
here and there he will �nd one who is oppos to the belief that the star have ani inﬂuenc in human aﬀair 
let him not wast logic with such a man but go straight to the task of convinc him by an appeal to fact 
for prefer select a period when the direct inﬂuenc are such as seem like to hit the sceptic with consider forc de�n the event make a care calcul of the time of it ful�lment and put them on paper which be yet unread by the man of commonsens should be place under cover seal and endors to be open onli after a certain date 
now a man who has been hammer rather sever and in quit an unexpect manner is usual open to convict of truth when he �nds that the natur and date of his disast have been accur foretold 
be a man of “commonsense� and not of intuit he will probabl think that the astrolog might even have save him from the consequ of his own lack of foresight 
so inde might the astrolog have done had he taken the manag of aﬀair from the begin but to step in halfway to arrest caus which are alreadi in oper and charg with inevit effect is requir too much of ani man short of a prime minist 
pg 112 there are certain thing which even the most astut deduct reason cannot forese and these are the point that should be utilis by the astrolog who seek to convinc other of the truth of his scienc 
a man cannot reason from his doorstep to a street accid 
if he could he would avoid it 
all men are not subject to accid howev 
but almost all are subject to bereav loss sick and chang of fortun 
those are the point which the astrolog intent on proselytis usual make use of 
but event need not be in futur to carri convict 
if it can be shown that by mathemat calcul the event of the past can be recit with precis and exact it is evid to the meanest intellect that noth hinder from an extens of such calcul into the futur 
and onc convinc of the reliabl of such claim to foreknowledg the practic man of the world is not slow to avail himself of it use 
but astrolog is not exhaust in the studi of individu horoscop for there are other depart of this extens scienc 
the inﬂuenc of the planet upon the weather as embodi in astrometeorolog the rise and fall of empir polit chang the outbreak of war of revolut of epidem as de�n by state astrolog so much in reput among the orient ruler the occurr of tidal wave earthquak and other seismic phenomena all form a part of the complet equip of the practic astrolog 
it would be superﬂu to recit here the numer and strike accur forecast which have been madebi pg 113 modern expon of the scienc but it is onli right to say that they reﬂect consider credit upon their author for the abovement depart of astrolog learn are by no mean in the same eﬃcient state as genethliac astrolog to an outlin of which this work is devot 
ancient it was otherwis and even in the east at this day they hold some secret of tradit knowledg concern which they are unduli mysteri and of which we have onli the evid afford by more exact predict upon certain point 
prejudic and ignor are the twin giant which bar the path of the world’ progress today even as they have ever done 
step by step they have been beaten back baﬄ by the light of reason harass by the arrow of truth 
the world is redeem it ancient heritag 
all that is now requir to establish the paramount truth of astrolog as a scienc is an imparti and thorough investig prefer at the hand of scienti�c men of it method and principl 
not that the truth is to be rati� at the hand of modern scientist see that their own teach constitut a mere shift orthodoxi liabl at ani moment to undergo a fundament chang in theori by the discoveri of a singl new fact—but that to such men right belong the duti of disprov the claim of astrolog to be consid as a scienc for it is a fact to be regret that certain member of their bodi have written against the subject in a spirit of prejudic and without adduc ani data in support of their content which ill becom ani man of scienti�c pretens and is abov all thing detriment to the caus of truth 
pg 114 chapter v a popular illustr in order to summaris and illustr the principl which have been enunci in the cours of this work i shall avail myself of the horoscop of mr joseph chamberlain who was born on the 8th of juli 1836 at highburi the time of birth be state to have been at about 230 in the morn 
calcul have sinc enabl us to �x the exact time of birth as at 2 h 36 m am

the sextil of the luminari is a power coordin and whenev sick superven there will be a speedi recoveri 
the semisquar aspect of mar while dispos to gouti aﬀect of the hand and feet will contribut vital energi and power to throw oﬀ diseas while at the same time predispos to accid and wound to the right shoulder or clavicl 
the rise sign give nervous energi and enorm capac for work which is due to high nervous tension support by a sound vital 
the onli hereditari predisposit is that indic by mar which induc to fever and gouti affect due to acid 
the health 
the moon is strong in the sign taurus but not particular well place in the 12th hous 
it has moreov the squar aspect of neptun and venus from �xed sign 
these indic point to function disord of the heart throat and excretori system 
on the other hand there are the good aspect of the sun jupit and uranus to counteract these advers tendenc and it is certain that strong recup power togeth with a normal good coordin of function would induc a speedi recoveri from ani ill to which he may be liabl

at the same time there is suﬃcient patienc method caution and watch to make this extrem de�nit of purpos veri eﬀect

but final he carri his purpos with a tour de forc 
that which he lack is adapt suaviti and abil to enter into the feel of other 
he is too ambiti to be selfcentr but yet too intent to be sympathet 
the rise of mercuri in trine aspect to saturn and uranus give consider mental capac a wide grasp of fact a wellinform apt and businesslik mind some origin construct and power of marshal fact and �gure patienc caution and secreci 
there is not much imagin and the sympathi are not wide

he is an omnivor devour of the access 
he take the small �sh by the hand and make a meal of them but he leav the ponder whale for those of greater imagin and more leisur habit 
the quadratur of mar to uranus will induc momentari outburst of temper and some irrit of natur but the charact i am delin is not such as can easili be play upon for it is remark lack in emot pg 118 suscept 
nevertheless the inspir faculti is by no mean absent and the presenc of neptun in the 9th hous in trine to the rise mercuri is an index of consider invent genius extrem rang of mental percept and telescop discern of futur event

the posit of the sun in conjunct with jupit in the sign cancer in sextil to the moon is the index of a high fortun and mean exceed a compet 
it is here worthi of note that cancer which in this horoscop hold the sun jupit and mercuri is the rule sign of south africa with which coloni mr chamberlain’ fortun have been for a long time so intim associ 
it is also worthi of note that both cecil rhode and barney barnato were born on the same day of the year the 5th of juli with the sun in the 14th degre of cancer 
in the former case the sun was conjoin with moon and venus in sextil to uranus and trine to neptun while in the latter case the sun was in trine to jupit 
in regard to mr chamberlain’ horoscop it will be observ that jupit which hold such eﬀect power for increas in the 2nd hous is also the ruler of the 7th and it is to be rememb that all partnership commerci or social which he has contract have so pg 119 far prove high satisfactori from a mere monetari point of view

foreword of all subject that have at ani time engag the attent of the world there is none more ancient than astrolog 
in the east—wher it first aros at a period of veri remot antiquity—it still hold sway and in everi part of the world especi among the learn it reign suprem until the middl of the seventeenth centuri 
that it not onli rule the daili action of individu but sway the council of princ is shown by the record of everi nation that has a histori and by none more fulli than by that of england yet the present generat seem never until quit late to have care to inquir on what basi this belief could have been for so mani age support 
dure the past ten year however—poss from a reaction grow out of the realism by which we have been so long oppressed—a new interest in these oldworld belief has sprung up and it is to satisfi that interest that this book contain the result of mani year studi was written 
chirom and physiognomi are both base on astrolog and are therefor quit in place as the second and third part of a work treat of the influenc of the star 
mani of the modern writer on chirom seem dispos to deni it affin to astrolog with which it is howev insepar connect 
dr saunder in the prefac to his exhaust work on chirom and physiognomi publish in 1671 and dedic to his friend lilli the great astrolog say for our more order proceed with the bodi of this work it is in the first place necessari to be observ that there are seven planet name stell� errantes—wand stars—which have each of them it separ charact as they are use in astrologi the which star have great power over inferior bodi and do each of them govern some part or other of man bodi and they especi have their materi exist in the hand and without astrolog chirom could not subsist and be subservi to true wisdom 
now whi in the face of this and mani other equal forcibl word among the oldworld author do the modern writer tri to forc their own crude theori upon us 
to drag the timehonour studi of chirom into the turmoil of nineteenthcenturi exist and—bi rob it of it mysticism—to strain it into unison with the realism of modern thought strike the earnest student with the same sens of incongru as would the hang of a carniv mask over the mystic calm featur of an antiqu statu

chapter i 
that a certain power deriv from �thereal natur pervad the whole earth is clear evid to all 
fire and air are alter by the motion of the �ther and these element in their turn encompass all inferior matter vari it as they themselv are vari act equal on earth and water on plant and anim 
the sun not onli by the chang of the season bring to perfect the embryo of anim the bud of plant and the spring of water but also by his daili movement bring light heat moistur dryness and cold 
the moon be of all the heaven bodi the nearest to earth has also much influenc and thing anim and inanim sympathis and vari with her 
by her chang river swell or are reduc the tide of the sea are rule by her rise and set and anim and plant are influenc as she wax or wane 
the star also produc in the ambient chapter ii 
the alphabet of astrolog the scienc of astrolog consist of four branch name mundan astrolog which is the art of forese by the aspect of the star at certain period the event like to happen to nation such as pestil war inund and earthquak atmospher astrolog which is the art of forese by the posit of the heaven bodi the qualiti of the weather at ani particular time or place the cast of nativ or the art of foretel from the posit of the star at the moment of birth the fate and charact of the nativ and horari astrolog or the art of forese by the posit of the heaven at the moment the result of ani busi or circumst 
as the two former branch are treat in the astrolog almanack issu everi year by zadkiel raphael orion and other it is needless to go into them but as the cast of nativ and the answer of horari question requir individu treatment the work of these two branch of astrolog after the ancient method shall be describ as clear as possibl 
befor the student can do anyth in astrolog he must master it alphabet—that is he must make himself thorough acquaint with the symbol use to repres the planet the sign of the zodiac and the aspect 
the planet recognis by the ancient astrolog are as we have seen seven in number and are as follow with their symbols—saturn jupit mar sol venus mercuri luna 
there are also the dragon head thus symbolis and the dragon tail 
these are neither planet nor sign of the zodiac nor constel but are onli the node or point where the eclipt is cross by the moon 
one of these point look northward where the moon begin her northern latitud and the other point southward where she commenc her south latitud 
the head of the dragon is consid of a benevol natur the tail of the dragon is of evil tendenc 
there are also the twelv sign of the zodiac which are as follow with their symbols— northern 
southern 
ari libra taurus scorpio gemini sagittarius cancer capricorn leo aquarius virgo pisc through these twelv sign the planet continu move and are ever in one or other of them 
they are divid into north and south 
the first six from ari to virgo are northern the latter six from libra to pisc are southern this is becaus the sun and planet when in the first six are north of the equat and when in the last six they are south of that line 
each point of the zodiac rise and set onc everi twentyfour hour occas by the earth revolut on it axi onc everi day therefor when ani given point is rise the opposit point must be set 
3 as the zodiac consist of 360 degre from the first point of ari until we come to that point again and as these are divid into twelv portion or sign they must consist of 30 degre each 
the aspect are five in number they repres certain posit which the planet bear to each other as they move through the sign of the zodiac they are as follow with their symbols— conjunct when two planet are in the same place viz in same degre of the same sign 
sextil when they are 60 degre or two sign apart 
squar when they are 90 degre or three sign apart 
trine when they are 120 degre or four sign apart 
opposit when they are 180 degre or six sign asund 
the conjunct is rather a posit than an aspect as planet can hard be said to aspect each other when they are in the same place 
when saturn is in the first degre of ari and ani planet in the same degre of that sign they are said to be in conjunct this is good or evil accord to the natur of the planet thus posit 
the trine is the most power of all the good aspect 
the sextil is favour 
the squar is evil 
the opposit is also veri evil 
there are sever other aspect sometim call the modern aspect invent by kepler but as they onli appear to complic what is at best a veri intric studi it is best to ignor them and adher in this as in the matter of the planet to the old method 
chapter iii 
concern the sign of the zodiac the zodiac is a band or belt measur about 14 degre in breadth but as venus sometim appear to have more than her real latitud it is more correct consid to be 18 degre in breadth 
the eclipt or path of the sun pass exact through the centr of the zodiac longitudin 
the ancient divid the zodiac into ten signs—libra be omit altogeth virgo and scorpio be merg into one thus virgoscorpio 
this account for the similar of their symbol 
ptolemi divid the zodiac into twelv equal part of 30 degre each 
he say the begin of the whole zodiac circl which in it natur as a circl can have no other begin or end capabl of be determin is therefor assum to be the sign ari which commenc at the vernal equinox in march 
one of the mani object urg against ptolemi system of astrolog is that the sign are continu move from their posit but ptolemi seem to have been awar of this motion of the sign and has met this object by what he say in the twentyfifth chapter of the first book of the tetrabiblo where he make it clear that the respect influenc he ascrib to the twelv sign were consid by him to belong rather to the place they occupi in the ambient than to the star of which they are compos and he especi speak of the ambient as produc the effect attribut to the respect sign of the zodiac when in the ascend in a nativ thus his astrolog is just as applic to modern astronomi as it was to his own 
the sign have been divid into four triplic thus fieri earthi airi and wateri 
the bicorpor or doublebodi sign are and the first half of 
the fruit sign are the barren sign are and 
these descript are use in show the modif brought to bear by the sign ascend on the planet influenc

chapter iv 
of the natur of the seven planet and of their essenti and accident digniti of the seven planet jupit and venus becaus of the heat and moistur predomin in them are consid by the ancient as benef or causer of good 
the moon is so consid for the same reason though in a less degre 
saturn and mar are causer of evil or malef the first from his excess of cold and the other from his excess of heat 
the sun and mercuri are deem of common influence—that is either of good or evil accord to the planet with which they are connect 
the planet have particular familiar with certain place in the zodiac by mean of part design as their hous and also by their triplic exalt and term 
the natur of their familiar by hous is as follows— cancer and leo are the most norther of all the twelv sign they approach nearer than the other sign to the zenith of this part of the earth and therebi caus warmth and heat they are consequ appropri as hous for the two princip and greater luminari leo for the sun as be masculin and cancer for the moon as be feminin 
saturn sinc he is cold and inim to heat move also in a superior orbit most remot from the luminari occupi the sign opposit to cancer and leo these are aquarius and capricorn and they are assign to him in consider of their cold and wintri natur 
jupit has a favour tempera and is situat beneath the sphere of saturn he therefor occupi the next two sign sagittarius and pisc 
mar is dri in natur and beneath the sphere of jupit he take the next two sign of a natur similar to his own viz ari and scorpio whose relat distanc from the hous of the luminari are injuri and discord 
venus possess a favour tempera and place beneath the sphere of mar take the next two sign taurus and libra 
these are of a fruit natur and preserv harmoni by the sextil distanc this planet is never more than two sign distant from the sun 
mercuri never has greater distanc from the sun than the space of one sign and is beneath all the other planet henc he is nearest to both luminari and the remain two sign gemini and virgo are allot to him 
the hous of the planet are readili shown by the follow tabl 
it is exact the same as that found in the mummycas of the archon of thebe in ancient egypt as may be seen at the british museum it will be seen at onc from this tabl that the sun and moon have each onli one hous assign them 
all planet are most power in that sign which constitut one of their hous 
planet receiv detriment in the sign opposit to those of their hous 
thus saturn would receiv detriment in cancer and leo which are the sign opposit to his hous capricornus and aquarius 
there are some sign in which the planet are found to be veri power though not to the same extent as when in their own hous these are call the exalt of the planet and the sign opposit to these are those in which they receiv their fall when they are consid to be weak in power 
saturn has his exalt in libra his fall would therefor be in ari 
he govern the airi triplic which is compos of the sign gemini libra and aquarius by day and in all the twelv sign he has these degre zodiac sign allot him by ptolemi for his term in ari 27 28 29 30

the mean of which is that if saturn should rise in ani of these degre it is a sign that he is not void of essenti digniti or if he is posit in ani of the follow degre which he is allow for his face or decan he is still not devoid of digniti 
this is to be understood of all the planet

chapter vi 
concern the twelv hous of heaven and their power the ancient astrolog divid the heaven into twelv hous 
the first house—thi is call the ascend and the planet rise therein—wheth well or illdignified—wil materi affect the mind bodili appear and fate of the nativ through his whole exist 
this hous is masculin and govern the head and face of man and if the planet mar be in this hous at the time of birth there will alway be some blemish or mole in the face of the nativ if a few out of the degre have ascend the scar or blemish is without fail on the upper part of the head if the middl part of the sign ascend the mark is in the middl of the face if the latter part of the sign is ascend the mark is near the chin 
this hous repres the head the tongu and the memori and it govern in colour white 
the second house—thi hous has signif of the nativ wealth and world good 
the hous is feminin rule the neck and the colour is green 
the third house—thi govern brother and sister short journey neighbour letter and write 
it is masculin and govern the hand arm and shoulder it colour are red and yellow mix 
the fourth house—thi rule the father inherit or properti of the nativ and show his condit at the close of life 
it is feminin and rule the stomach breast and lung it colour is red 
the fifth house—thi signifi the children of the nativ also his success in specul and hazard game the pleasur he enjoy and the wealth of the father 
it rule the heart back and liver is masculin and repres in colour black and white mix 
the sixth house—thi concern the nativ servant sheep goat and small cattl 
it also signifi the father kindr 
this hous is feminin 
it rule the belli and intestin and it colour is black 
the seventh hous give judgment of marriag and describ the man or woman in all love question 
it is masculin it rule the haunch and it colour is black 
the eighth hous argu of death of legaci and will also of the kind of death a man shall die it is a feminin hous 
it rule the lower part of the trunk of the bodi it colour are green and black 
the ninth hous give judgment on voyag and long journey and also on event happen to the wife kindr 
it rule the hip and thigh 
it is a masculin hous it colour are green and white 
the tenth hous is call the midheaven and is feminin 
this concern the nativ mother and also his call 
it rule the knee and ham and it colour are red and white 
the eleventh hous repres friend and friendship 
it is masculin and rule the leg 
the twelfth house—thi hous is often call the evil d�mon for it is the hous of sorrow selfundo enemi and imprison 
it govern great cattl 
it is feminin and rule the feet and toe and in colour it govern green 
the strongest hous are the first the ascend and the tenth the midheaven 
the first fourth seventh and tenth are call angular hous and repres the four cardin point of the compass thus the first is east the seventh west the fourth is north and the tenth south 
the second fifth eighth and eleventh hous are call succed hous the third sixth ninth and twelfth hous are term cadent hous see plate 1 
ani planet posit in a cadent hous is regard as weak in it effect on the nativ 
it is necessari to have thorough master the influenc of the twelv hous as well as those of the seven planet and of the sign of the zodiac befor attempt to cast a nativ or to work a horari question 
chapter vii 
an explan of various term use in astrolog ascens right—th distanc ani bodi or point in the heaven is from the begin of the eclipt or first point of ari 
it is measur in degre and minut of a degre 
it is thus abbrevi a r ascens oblique—if a star be not on the equat it will when it rise form an angl with that part of the equat which is rise at the same time and this is call it ascension difference—thi ad to it right ascens a r if it have south declin but subtract from it if it have north declin give it obliqu ascens 
applic signifi the approach of two planet and is of three kind first when a planet swift of motion appli to one of slower progress for exampl we will suppos mercuri posit in 16 degre of the sign gemini and mar in 21 degre of the same sign both be in direct motion mercuri be swifter would overtak and form a conjunct with mar which is term a direct applic 
the second kind of applic is form by two retrograd planet thus we will suppos mercuri in 16 degre of gemini and saturn in 15 degre of the same sign both retrograd 
mercuri be the swiftest planet appli to saturn a more ponder planet by retrograd and this is call a retrograd applic 
the third kind of applic is when one planet be direct in motion meet anoth which is retrograd for instanc we will suppos mercuri retrograd in 16 degre of gemini and saturn direct in motion in 12 degre of the same sign here mercuri be the higher planet appli to a conjunct of saturn by a retrograd motion 
these two last are consid evil applic 
it should also be rememb that the superior planet saturn jupit and mar never appli to the inferior planet venus mercuri and the moon except by retrograd motion but the inferior planet appli in both way 
besieg signifi a planet situat between the two malevol planet saturn and mar thus if saturn were in the 12th degre of ari jupit in the 14th and mar in the 16th jupit would then be besieg by the two malef planet saturn and mar 
this is of cours an evil posit 
cazimi—a planet is said to be in cazimi when it is in the heart of the sun that is onli 17 minut befor or after the sun 
all astrolog agre that a planet is fortifi by this posit but a planet when combust is veri evil in it influenc 
direct motion signifi that a planet is move on it natur cours accord to the success of the sign of the zodiac thus a planet is direct in motion when it move from ari to taurus or from taurus to gemini 
frustrat mean the approach of a swift planet to an aspect with one of slower motion but befor it can approach near enough to join that aspect the more weighti planet is join to some other by which the first aspect is frustrat 
hayz is when a masculin diurnal planet is situat abov the horizon in the daytim or when a feminin nocturn planet is place below the horizon in the nighttim this is fortun in it influenc 
node—that part of the eclipt where a planet pass out of north into south latitud is it south node that where it goe into north latitud is it north node 
orient and occidental—a planet when orient rise befor the sun when occident set after him and is seen abov the horizon when the sun is down consequ when a planet is orient it is posit in the east and when occident in the west 
from the fourth hous eastward to the tenth is orient and from the tenth westward to the fourth is occident 
but or are orient between the first and tenth and it opposit quarter and are occident between the tenth and seventh and it opposit quarter 
void of cours is when a planet is separ from anoth planet and doe not dure it continu in the same sign form ani aspect with ani other planet 
this most usual happen with the moon 
the effect of this is to face chapter viii 
chapter viii 
of the figur of the heaven this was former term a horoscop but is now more general call a figur of the heaven 
it is simpli a scheme or plan repres an accur pictur of the heavens—that is of the posit of the sun moon and planet and in some instanc of the fix star also for the moment at which a child is born 
in horari question the figur is drawn for the requir time which may be the moment of the propound of a question to an astrolog or of the occurr of ani event of the result of which astrolog inform is desir 
this map which contain the twelv divis alreadi describ as the twelv hous of heaven may be drawn in either a squar or circular form 
lilli and other medi�v writer use both form indiscrimin but as the latter is more easili understood the diagram plate 2 is drawn up in that manner 
it will be seen that it is form of three circl 
in the centr space the date time and place of the event of a horari question are enter and in a nativ the name sex and moment of birth of the nativ 
the next space divid into twelv equal part for the hous is reserv for the planet and in the outer space are place the sign of the zodiac with the number of their degre on the cusp of each hous 
the cusp of the hous are repres by that line between each hous 
have obtain an ephemeri or astrolog almanack 7 for the year requir we must find the sider time for the day and month of the birth or question then if the time of the event be befor noon we must deduct the differ between the given time and noon from the sider time of the day for exampl on the day of the event the 9th januari 1889 the sider time at noon is shown by the ephemeri to be 19 hour 16 minut 51 second if the birth had been at 9 am 
the differ between 9 am and noon is 3 hour 
we should therefor have to deduct 3 hour from 19 hour 16 minut 51 second which give 16 hour 16 minut 51 second the sider time requir 
as the event is suppos to happen at 3 in the afternoon we must add the differ between noon and the time given to the sider time of the day 
the differ between noon and 3 pm is 3 hour and as the sider time on the 9th januari 1889 is 19 hour 16 minut 51 second we add 3 hour to this amount which give 22 hour 16 minut 51 second the sider time requir 
we must now proceed to place the sign for 3 pm on the 9th januari 1889 which is thus done we turn to the tabl of hous which will be found at the end of the ephemeri and have found under the column head sider time the nearest time to 22 hour 16 minut 51 second which in this case is 22 hour 16 minut 48 second for the latitud of london we see in the next column head 10 the sign pisc and the number 3� opposit our sider time show that the third degre of pisc is on the cusp of the 10th hous in the next column head 11 we see and the number 7� we therefor place 7� on the cusp of the 11th hous next 24� on the 12th then 7� 5′ on the ascend or first hous 23� on the 2nd and 10� on the 3rd for the remain hous we place the sign in order opposit to those alreadi given keep the same number of degre to each correspond hous and sign 
the opposit hous to the 10th is the 4th and the opposit sign to is we therefor place 3� on the cusp of the 4th hous and so on of the rest 
it will howev now be seen that the two sign and are miss these sign are intercept which mean that they lie between two hous without occupi the cusp of either they must therefor be place in their order between the cusp of the hous 
this is of cours not alway the case and some horoscop will have no intercept sign 
how to place the planet 
in the ephemeri the longitud of the planet are given daili for mean noon so to find the exact place of a planet for a given time we must note the differ of longitud between the previous noon and noon of the day for draw the map for am and for pm the differ between noon of the day and noon of the day after 
this differ is the motion of the planet in 24 hour which we must work thus as 24 hour are to—hour ie the differ between the given time and noon so is the daili motion to the motion requir 
for exampl the at noon on the 6th januari is omit second in 19� 29′ and on the 10th januari at noon he is in 20� 30′ which give a daili motion of 59 minut 
we must find his place for 3 pm on the 9th januari 
as 24 hour are to 3 hour so are 59 minut to the time requir this equal about 7 minut which we add to the s longitud at noon on the 9th 
if the event had been for am this amount would have been deduct from the s longitud at noon on the day of the event 
we must proceed in the same way for the other planet and place them in the map accord to their posit in respect to the degre on the cusp of the hous 
the will be in 19� 36′ or about the middl of the 7th hous 
and note that the number of degre of a sign on the cusp of ani hous show that that sign commenc in the previous hous 
suppos the had been 1� of we should then have place it in the 6th hous a littl below the cusp of the 7th 
when a planet is retrograd shown in the ephemeri thus r we add the amount to the longitud when the event is befor noon or am and deduct it from the longitud when the event is after noon or pm 
the mode of give the judgment on a horoscop will be shown farther on

to know when ani of these fix star will affect the horoscop we must note the sign and degre on the cusp of the hous and if on consult the ephemeri ani of these star should be found to be ascend or descend within five degre of the sign upon the cusp of the sever hous they must be enter in the same manner as the planet and their qualiti weigh accord to the natur of the planet or planet with which they correspond as shown by the tabl given

chapter xi 
on form a general judgment on a nativ respect the distribut of the doctrin of nativ we are to consid first the parent then the durat of life the shape and figur of the bodi after these the qualiti of the mind then as to fortun in regard to honour as well as wealth 
in success to these the charact of the employ the question relat to marriag children and friendship then that concern travel and last that concern the kind of death which await the nativ from the configur of the heaven at his birth 
the parents—in conform with natur say ptolemi the sun and saturn are allot to the person of the father and the moon and venus to that of the mother and the mode in which these luminari and planet may be found posit with refer to each other as well as to other planet and star will intim the situat of affair affect the parent 
if mar should be in bad aspect to the sun the father will receiv some injuri to the face or die sudden but a long life is presag if jupit or venus be in ani mode whatev configur with either the sun or saturn 
if mar be succed to the moon or venus or in quartil or opposit to them or if saturn be similar aspect to the moon onli and both of them be void of cours or retrograd or cadent advers accid and diseas will attend the mother should they on the other hand be swift in motion and place in angl they portend that her life will be short or grievous afflict 
should the sun be configur in ani mode whatev with the moon or venus or should venus herself be harmoni configur with the moon either by the sextil the trine or the conjunct the mother will live long 
concern the durat of the nativ own life the hylegliacal9 place are accord to ptolemi the sign on the angl of the ascend from the fifth degre abov the horizon to the twentyfifth degre below it the thirti degre in dexter sextil thereto constitut the eleventh hous also the thirti degre in dexter quartil form the midheaven abov the earth those in dexter trine make the ninth hous and last those in opposit belong to the angl of the west 
among these place the degre which constitut the midheaven are entitl to prefer as be of a more potent influenc the degre in the ascend are next in virtu then the degre in the eleventh hous succed to the midheaven then those in the angl of the west and last those in the ninth hous which preced the midheaven 
he also hold that the sun the moon and the ascend to be consid as the four princip liabl to be elect to the offic of prorogator—or hyleg 
these view are not adopt by the modern astrolog but as this is a book set forth the ancient method it is needless to discuss the various object made by them to this as to some other of the theori laid down by ptolemi 
among the four prorog alreadi given the sun by day is to be prefer provid he is place in one of the hylegliac place and if not the moon but if the moon also should not be so posit that planet is to be elect as hyleg which may have most claim to dominion in refer to the sun the moon and the ascend which mean that the planet should have dominion in ani one of the place where these are situat by at least three digniti 
if howev no planet should be so circumstanc the ascend is then to be taken as hyleg 
by night the moon is to be elect as prorog provid in like manner she should be in some prorogatori place and if she be not the sun if he also be not in ani prorogatori place then that planet which may have most right of dominion in refer to the moon and the anteced full moon and the part of fortun 
but if there be no planet claim dominion in the mode prescrib the ascend must be taken in case a new moon had last preced the birth but if a full moon the part of fortun 
if the two luminari and also some rule planet of appropri condit should be each posit in a prorogatori place then provid one luminari may be found to occupi some place more import and influenti than the other that luminari must be chosen but should the rule planet occupi the stronger place and have prerog of dominion suitabl to the condit of both luminari the planet must then be prefer to either of them 
when the hyleg has been determin by the forego rule then note whether it is support by benevol planet in good aspect toward it and free from affliction—that is from evil aspect from evil planets—if so the life is like to continu and the constitut to be strong but if the hyleg whether it be the sun the moon or the ascend be afflict with evil planet and there be no assist from good planet the child will die in infanc if there be some assist from good planet but yet the evil aspect exceed the good the constitut will be weak and the first train of evil direct will destroy the life 
concern the disposit and qualiti of the mind we must look princip to the planet in the ascend the influenc of which over mind and bodi have alreadi been given in the chapter on the seven planet 
we must howev alway bear in mind that mercuri has chief dominion over the mental faculti whilst the sentient passion are govern by the moon and the planet in the ascend 
the moon wellaspect that is in trine sextil or conjunct to mercuri at birth will give to the nativ excel abil ingenu versatil and wit 
even the evil aspect of the squar and opposit are better than no aspect at all though these sometim produc a cynic and obstin natur 
the abil of those born when mercuri is in cazimi that is within seventeen minut of the sun centr are of the highest order 
mercuri in conjunct with saturn at birth give clear judgment and a love of occult subject 
venus in good aspect with mercuri give love of music and an artist natur 
if mercuri and the moon throw no aspect to each other and are afflict by mar and saturn the nativ will be liabl to becom insan 
10 the fortun of wealth is determin by the sun and the moon if they are in good posit that is angular and wellaspect by the two luminari the nativ will be rich 
if the sun and the moon are well place and if there be benef star in the midheaven the nativ will rank high in the world 
if the contrari the nativ never rise abov mediocr and if saturn afflict the midheaven he meet disgrac 
if mar is strong and in good aspect to the sun and moon he will gain militari glori 
jupit on the midheaven and the sun and moon in trine to each other the moon have the trine of jupit is one of the best posit for rise in the world 
jupit in the tenth hous will caus the nativ to do fair well in the world but saturn in that hous if not extrem wellaspect will bring him to shame and beggari 
concern the natur of employ the dominion of the employ is claim by the sun and by the planet on the midheaven 
if mercuri should rule alon he produc writer teacher of scienc merchant and banker also if wellaspect to saturn and the moon astrolog and student of all occult matter if jupit is in conjunct then the nativ will be an orat actor or painter and his pursuit will lead him into the societi of person of rank 
venus rule make winemerch dealer in colour dye perfum drug garment or apparel c if connect with saturn she make person have to do with amus player juggler c if with jupit person attend exhibit and priest who have much person decor such as cathol priest bishop c and they will gain by women 
mar rule alon make martial men and if in scorpio cancer or pisc naval men 
11 the sun join with him be near the midheaven or in aspect make person deal with fire or metal the latter especi if in taurus or leo 
if mar be separ from the sun he make shipwright smith agriculturist stonemason and carpent 
if saturn bear testimoni in addit to mar person becom marin worker in mine well vault c underground keeper of cattl cook butcher 
if jupit join with mar they will be soldier innkeep taxgather mechan 
if mercuri and venus becom joint arbit of employ they produc musician dancer poet weaver and painter c jupit in connect with them make magistr and senat and also teacher of youth 
mercuri with mar make surgeon statuari boxer 
if mercuri be more power they will be scientif and if mar be stronger they will be more violent and cruel in their practic 
12 if saturn join these two they will be thiev especi if the moon be in ill aspect to mercuri if be in ill aspect to they will be robber or assassin 
if jupit join and they engag in honour warfar and are industri 
if venus and mar rule togeth person will be dyer worker in tin lead gold silver and medic drug 
the moon regul the employ and separ from the sun and form an aspect with mercuri inclin to the pursuit of astrolog spiritu and magic 
concern marriag ptolemi has laid down some veri clear rule 
he advis person about to marri to have a care that the luminaries—that is the sun and moon in their respect nativities—ar in concord 
it is of happi auguri if the moon in the bridegroom nativ is in good aspect—that is in trine or sextil to the sun in the bride nativ 
the squar or opposit aspect form between the luminari in the two nativ indic discord and separ and veri evil effect follow if the malef planet saturn and mar have a bad aspect to the sun and moon in both nativ 
if venus be with them the separ will be caus by adulteri 
good planet such as jupit and venus place between the luminari in both nativ show much happi 
in men nativ the moon must be chiefli consid in regard to marriag 
should she be in her first or third quarter at birth the man will marri under thirti or if older his wife will be a veri young woman 
if the moon be configur with saturn she entir deni marriag 
if she should be in a sign of singl form such as libra or taurus the nativ will marri onli onc but if she should be place in a doublebodi sign such as pisc or sagittarius the man will marri more than onc 
if the moon make applic to the benef the wive will be good and true but if she make applic to evil planet the wive will prove either bad or of a quarrelsom disposit 
for exampl if saturn receiv the moon applic the wife will prove troublesom and moros yet constant and industri if jupit receiv it the wife will be decor good and econom if mar bold and refractori if venus cheer handsom and agreeabl if mercuri sensibl prudent and clever 
women in whose nativ venus is configur with jupit or mercuri are virtuous and wellconduct but when venus is with mar and no other planet is there women born under such aspect are liabl to becom licenti 
mar in squar to venus show adulteri 
for women the sun is to be chiefli regard in estim their chanc of marriag and happi 
if the sun be orient ie between the ascend and midheaven or between the descend and nadir the nativ will marri in her youth or when old to a young man 
if the sun be occident the nativ will marri late in life or when young to an old man 
if the sun be in a sign of singl form she will marri but onc if in a doublebodi sign or configur with sever orient planet in one sign she will marri more than onc 
if saturn be configur with the sun the husband will be steadfast prosper and industri 
jupit configur with the sun give a good benevol and honour husband 
mar say ptolemi give a sever husband void of affect and intract 
venus give an amiabl husband of handsom appear 
mercuri give one who is provid and expert in busi and of a live and cheer tempera 
if mar be separ from venus and saturn yet have the assist of jupit men will lead virtuous live 
if mar be configur with venus onli men are of a licenti tempera 
saturn when in the 7th hous of a nativ bring either unhappi in marriag or earli death of one or other of the marri peopl 
the sun bad aspect by saturn in the nativ of a woman and the moon afflict by the same planet in the nativ of a man will bring troubl in love and marriag 
descript of the wife or husband—th planet with the sign in which it is place which is posit near the cusp of the 7th hous must be taken to describ the person 
if no planet should happen to be so place then we must go by the sign alon 
benef planet in the 8th hous show that the wife or husband will be rich unfortun planet show the revers 
children—a regard the probabl of have children the 10th and 11th hous must be consult and should there be no planet in them then the opposit the 4th and 5th hous must be consid 
the moon jupit and venus are said to be giver of children the sun mar and saturn deni children or give veri few and those either die earli or are a sourc of troubl to their parent 
mercuri either give or deni accord to the planet with which he may happen to be posit 
if the sun and malef be in barren sign or in masculin sign and in the beforenam hous there will be no children but if they be in fruit or feminin or common sign there may be children but they will be delic and shortliv 
if jupit the moon and venus are welldignifi in the 10th and 11th hous the children born will attain rank and distinct in the world 
friend and enemies—person born under the same sign of the zodiac are like to be sympathet so also if the planet in the ascend of one person nativ is one which is friend to that which rise in the ascend in the other 
thus a person whose rule planet is venus would be attract by one in whose ascend mar is domin and a person whose rule planet is the moon rare contract a warm friendship with one who has mar in the ascend of his nativ and vice vers� 
the friendship and enmiti of the planet have alreadi been given in the chapter on the influenc of the seven planet 
mar in bad aspect to the sun or moon in the 7th hous caus quarrel in marri life 
travelling—th posit of the moon and mar are here to be consid 
if they should be in a cadent posit the nativ will travel a great deal 
the moon in a wateri sign caus much travel by water 
ptolemi tell us that mar in squar or opposit to the sun or moon will caus much travel in foreign countri 
if the benef are conjoin with the moon the journey will be safe and pleasant if with the malef they will produc mischanc and illhealth in travel 
mercuri ascend at birth in a doublebodi or moveabl sign show a great disposit to travel 
if a malef affect the moon should be in the wateri sign of cancer scorpio or pisc shipwreck and even death by drown may ensu dure travel 
of the manner of death—if the hyleg and ascend should be wellaspect and if either jupit venus mercuri or the moon welldignifi should appear in the eighth hous the nativ will die a natur death 
if either the sun or moon should be bad aspect by mar or saturn in the eighth hous it is signific of a violent or remark death 
saturn caus linger death and mar those which are sudden 
saturn indic death by chronic diseas rheumat agu and paralysi 
chapter xii 
concern direct and horari question we have seen in the chapter on the judgment of a nativ that by the consider of the posit of the planet and of the sun and moon in the twelv hous what the general fortun of the nativ will be in the whole cours of his life but the art of direct measur out the time into year month week and day and thus inform us when we may expect in particular what is general promis us in the nativ 
direct are of two kind primari and secondari and are base upon arithmet calcul of the time of the event caus by the aspect of the signif that is of the sun or the moon with the place of the planet 
they are found upon the familiar of the star amongst each other in the zodiac after the nativ and show by calcul the distanc of the place of a signif at the moment of the nativ from the place it must reach befor it can join the aspect which distanc is call the arc of direct 
some astrolog consid what are call mundan direct which are distanc in the world measur by the semiarc and are wholli independ of the zodiac 
these were invent by placidus but as ptolemi doe not treat of them they will not be consid here 
it must alway be rememb that—in directions—th place of a planet at the time of the nativ is call the planet itself although it may not be there when the signif arriv thus if we wish to direct the sun to the conjunct of jupit we must do so to the posit which that planet occupi at the moment of the nativ 
when the arc of direct is found the sun right ascens must be ad to it and the sun will be the right ascens without latitud of that place in the zodiac at which when the sun arriv the direct will be complet 
for everi day of the sun approach to this point a year must be ad and thus the time when the event is like to happen is point out these primari direct howev cannot be depend upon to produc an event of great import unless the secondari direct agre but where the nativ is weak the primari direct alon is power enough to kill especi if it should be oppos to the hyleg and misfortun will alway happen if the posit of the planet at the moment of birth are unfortun without the coincid of ani secondari direct 
secondari direct are those daili aspect to the luminari which happen after birth everi day of which is reckon for a year two hour for a month thirti minut for a week and four minut for a day 
13 thus whatev aspect take place in the first day of the nativ life will develop their effect in the first year and those of the second day in the second year so that should the nativ live fifti year his secondari direct for his fiftieth year will aris from the aspect which took place on the fiftieth day after his birth 
the ancient astrologers—particular the egyptians—us to predict the event of a nativ wholli from these secondari directions14 in which the moon should be chiefli consid for in those day on which she come to an evil aspect with the malef saturn or mar the year correspond to those day will be peculiar unfortun and danger to the nativ and where on the contrari the moon is wellaspect to the benef the year correspond to those day will be veri fortun a good direct give prosper in that matter which the signif indic thus we direct the sun to signifi the nativ prefer or disgrac his good or bad health and the favour or disesteem of great personag 
the direct of the moon refer to the natur of the nativ journey whether prosper or the revers his marriag his wife his women friend and kinsfolk 
the direct of saturn signifi the nativ inherit build possess and also his fear jealousi and mistrust 
jupit is direct as regard glori renown rich children and religion 
mar is direct for the nativ lawsuit animos and victori he also show the estat of brethren 
venus is direct for marriag love and pleasur and all matter in connect with women 
mercuri is direct for a knowledg of the amount of wit understand trade industri and journey of the nativ also for distinct in scholarship and all intellectu pursuit 
the horoscop or ascend is direct to signifi the life affect and manner of the nativ 
the midheaven direct affect the posit and career of the nativ 
if the direct are to good aspect of benevol planet they signifi prosper both of mind and bodi cheer and all manner of earth happi but if the horoscop should have direct to the ill aspect of the malef mar or saturn then evil is to be expect of the natur given by the malevol star 
if direct to the good aspect such as the trine or sextil of these evil planet the misfortun is not so great and even in some instanc good may be predict 
as for exampl the horoscop direct to the trine or sextil of mar give prefer by arm the same aspect toward saturn would indic success in build or in mine or some call connect with metal 
the occasion differ in the life tast health marriag and pecuniari affair of twin born within ten or twenti minut of each other are account for by the fact that at the birth of the first child the last degre of a sign may ascend with planet therein or a planet in the 2nd hous at 5 pm may be in the 1st at 515 pm and the earli degre of anoth sign may be exact on the ascend at the birth of the second child 
a planet may reach the mc or ani other of the four cardin point at say 10 pm and ten minut later have pass off when it power would have great diminish 
though the sign rise and set at the rate of 15� per hour in our latitud from 50� to 60� north it often happen that 30� will ascend in fiftytwo minut 
horari question are question ask at a certain time when a person feel anxious concern ani undertak or impend event 
a figur or map of the heaven like that erect for a nativ is drawn out for the minut in which the question is ask and if the astrolog be skil and the querist sincere—that is not put the question from frivol motives—th answer will in general be true for the whole is the effect of that sympathi which pervad all natur and which is the keynot of all divin under whatsoev form it is practis 
in horari question the sign ascend and it lord repres the querent and to these the moon is ad and must be consid with the lord of the ascend 
the hous to which the thing belongs—about which enquiri is made—i the signif of that person and thing and everi other hous and it lord are to be consid accord to their respect signif so as to indic the mean and person by which the event about which the enquiri are made will be acceler or retard 
the date of event are regul by the sign and angl 
for exampl should the signif of the event be in a movabl sign and an angl the event will come to pass in the same number of day as there are degre between the signif aspect and the star to which it is direct if the aspect be by applic if by separ the thing will not take place at all 
in one of the succed hous movabl sign give month common sign year and fix sign bring about the event after much delay and when all hope of it are past 
signif in ani of the cadent hous seldom do anyth and should they bring about an event at all they do so after much wait and with much troubl and vexat 
the matter of horari question is veri well treat in lilli grammar of astrolog publish in 1647 and by way of explain the manner in which this branch of astrolog is work we give a facsimil of a map of a horari question to be found in this book with verbatim lilli method of deal with that particular question 
judgment of the figur given in plate—liv in london where we have few or no small cattl as in the countri i cannot give exampl of such creatur but i onc set the figur preced concern a dogg which is in the natur of small beast which dogg was miss 
the question to me was what part of the citi they should search and if he should ever be recov 
the querent was signifi by the sign ascend and the lord thereof for in his person he was saturnin and vitiat accord to the dragon tail in the ascend in his natur mind and understanding—that is he was deform in bodi and of a covet disposit 
the sign of the sixth hous and his lord signifi the dogg for that sign stand for sheep hog and small cattl 
the sign of gemini is west and by south the quarter of the heaven is west mercuri the signif of the dogg is in libra a western sign but southern quarter of heaven tend toward the west the moon is in virgo a southwest sign and verg toward the western angl 
the strength of the testimoni be thus examin i found the plural to signifi the west and therefor i judg that the dogg ought to be westward from the place where the owner live which was at templ bar wherefor i judg that the dogg was about long acr or the upper part of druri lane 
in regard that mercuri the signif of the beast was in a sign of the same triplic as gemini the ascend which signifi london and appli to a trine aspect of the cusp of the sixth hous i judg that the dogg was not out of the line of communic but was in the same quarter of which i was more confirm by the trine of the sun and saturn 
the sign in which mercuri appear was libra—an airi sign therefor i judg that the dogg was in some chamber or upper room and kept privat or in great secreci becaus the moon was under the beam of the sun and mercuri the moon and the sun were in the eighth hous and becaus the sun on the monday follow would appli by trine to saturn the lord of the ascend and the moon to trine of mar have exalt in the ascend i intim to the owner of the beast that in my opinion he should have his dogg again or news of his dogg or small beast upon the monday follow or near that time which was true for a gentleman of the querent acquaint sent home the dogg the veri same day about ten in the morn who by accid come to see a friend in long acr found the dogg chain up under a tabl and know the dogg to be the querent sent him home as abov said to my veri great credit and no doubt also to the great satisfact of the dogg himself

if virgo or pisc be on the ascend the nativ will creat his own digniti but if ari or libra be there he will caus his own death 
venus give pleasur to the nativ in that part of the bodi which may be rule by the sign she occupi 
it is the same with other star 
should a diseas begin when the moon may be in a sign occupi at the birth by some malef or in quartil or opposit to ani such sign such diseas will be most sever and if the malef also behold the said sign it will be danger 
on the other hand there will be no danger if the moon be in a place held at the time of birth by some benef 
in all horari question rememb that there is no afflict to the moon so great as when she is in conjunct with the sun the ill aspect for the malef must affect her but no evil aspect is so power as her conjunct 
mercuri in trine or sextil to the moon give the capac for acquir foreign languag 
in bad aspect to the moon make the nativ envious sarcast illnatur given to lie and thiev 
saturn in trine or sextil to venus show much power of attach to wife and famili

those born near noon are general success in life owe to the sun influenc be then most power 
those born near midnight are by no mean so fortun as those born at midday and it is a singular peculiar in such nativ that the most remark event of their live take place after their thirtieth year and they are also certain of some kind of a name after death meritori or otherwis accord to what their horoscop declar 
person born near midnight are veri imagin and subject to see vision dream dream and to be believ in the unseen world 
in all travel the moon is to be consid for she is a general signifi of journey whether by sea or land 
when the moon is besieg between mar and the sun in a nativ it argu a short life to the nativ 
mercuri if posit in one of the hous of saturn in trine or sextil to that planet give excel understand and if the moon be also welldignifi the nativ is much given to the studi of occult scienc and will have much renown in that particular 
those born with the moon power in their horoscop would do well to be guid by her aspect in their daili avoc 
if she should be in trine or sextil to jupit it is a good day to seek favour of the great or to make arrang with employ 
when she is in trine or sextil to mercuri all intellectu matter taken in hand will be like to prosper 
when she is so aspect to venus matter undertaken with refer to love marriag or friendship will have a happi issu 
when she is in squar or opposit she would have of cours the contrari effect 
the sun and moon in conjunct with mercuri give to the nativ great intellectu abil 
those who have the benevol planet jupit and venus well posit in either the ascend or the midheaven at birth will alway be much belov dure the whole cours of their live

i w kelli recent shift in astrolog idea classic tradit astrolog was associ with prognost and relat specif testabl hypothes about planetari configur and human activ 
until the twentieth centuri astrolog have held that the stellar connect main reflect actual outward human behavior but to day there is a tendenc to claim that the stellar connect reflect onli in ner life 
to appreci the shlft in claim consid first the view of charl carter who was the leadmg british astrolog in the midtwentieth centuri practic experi wiu soon convinc the most sceptic that the bodi of the solar system indic if they do not actual produc chang in 1 our mind 2 our feel and emo ion 3 our physic bodi 4 our extern affair and relationship with the world at larg 1925 p 14 
although everi birth chart was differ and mani astrolog factor had to be assess often with mutual conflict indic it was conced that there was an observ relat specif someth in common that should be exhibit by peopl with a particular planetari configur in their birth chart horoscop 
as the dutch psychologist jan van rooij point out if one take 100 peopl wrhthe sun in ari they should have someth in common irr spectiv of other astrologcdfactor 
and this common should be derent from the com mon factor in 100 peopl uith the sun in taurus irrespect of addit factor 1994 p 55 
on this basi we should not expect to see the influenc of a particular factor on a particular person 
but examin larg group of peopl should allow common to be detect if they exist 
contrast this with the view of psychotherapist and astrolog dr glenn perri perhap the leadmg propo nent of modern inner psycholog astrolog also known as astropsycholog and archetyp astrolog in the unit state today astrolog doe not deal with quantiti that can be object measur 
the birth chart depict the structur and dynam of conscious 
it shift the emphasi from predict outcom to interpret the meonirzg of outcom as they relat to the inner life of the person 1993 pp 
7 8 9 
further astrolog onli play a role in the mental plane and doe not ex press itself consist or systemat in event or behavior terpstra 1994 p 42 
here carter direct connect with outward behavior and ex ternal event is deni 
instead the connect is with the unobserv in ner life 
when leadmg astrolog cannot even agre on what astrolog deal with other confict and problem can onli further reduc the plausibhti of astrolog

cornehus state this could occur becaus there are two differ order of influenc one from the constel and the other from the earthsun cycl or altern we can view both zodiac as two reflect of the same symbol form 


that both show in their own dif ferent way p 32 
the obfusc order of influenc and reflecuon 


show in their own way are nowher clarifi henc we are no h r ther in our understand after be told this than we were befor 
xlhat about peopl who are born at the same time and have m e r e n t destini 
l h s has been a standard argument against astrolog 
the same as trolog tell us the singular horoscop can be1 read as a signatur for these particular twin with m e r e n t group of planet describ the two individu 


where frequent one twin answer to the sun and the other to the moon in the same horoscop cornelius et al 1995 p 131 
here the term frequent refer to inch not compeumg to avoid dsconfir mation 
we are also entitl to ask how one would tell which one is sun and which one is moon but no answer is p r v i d e d if 
that doesnt work cor nelius et al 
remind us that we can alway interpret astrolog symbol in a metaphor way for exampl sigmund freud was born on a differ ent contin but within minut of robert perri 
freud discov the un conscious and perri discov the north pole p 131 see also p 96 
henc these timetwin were both scover 
if interpret encom pass both liter and symbol includ metaphor are equal adrni sibl with astrolog claim then we cannot fail to find a fit between the horoscop and the person 
the posit side to this is never have to admit you are wrong the negat side say veri littl of import 
invok negativesa fourth popular respons is to say that the phe nomena astrolog deal with are veri subtl and elus and what we need are more creativ way of investig them 
for exampl even though a larg consist bodi of research converg on the view that sun sign are a varieti of ad hoc rule could be use for exampl oldestsun o r for op ositesex win malesun or it could be whichev one on inspect fit best 
at the end o r t h e day all chat

further the noccb pole wasnt discov at a 
everybodi knew where and what it was 
1042 i w 
kelli not valid the astrolog harvey could still say it is absolut correct to say that there is no evid for sign and hous as yet 


1982 p 47 itahc harvey and twelv year later after again acknowledg the lack of evi denc tell us i am person still convinc that given more sensit and imagin test confirm of the realiti of sunsign typolog and the sign general will be obtain 1994 p v 
sinc it is difficult to prove a negat in such case this posit can be maintain indefinit 
a col lorari is that astrolog with incompat posit on fundament tent can adopt the same intransig attitud in regard to their own belief 
such a postur in the face of negat evid can guarante a static system and a lack of progress 
it also contradict the suppos eas with which astrolog ical connect were first recogn 
as perri 1993 tell us of the an cient the partial if not complet validlti of astrolog was selfevid to anyon w h g to attempt a serious studi of the subject p 3 
this dis crepanc is in need of explan 
furthermor appeal to the selfevid have not been veri fruit guid to truth in the histori of idea 
blame faulti methodsfin one can say that if you are obtain negat result you must be do it wrong 
you are use the wrong meth odolog the wrong paradigm or both 
this approach has been adopt by increas number of astrolog sinc the 1950s when research and nega tive result got undenvay 
west 1991 for exampl contend that scien tific critic of astrolog are irrelev becaus astrolog is a system of magic p 223 where magic is the attempt to master the fundament law of reson that have produc the cosmos p 220 
west was insuf ficient explicit about this system of magic and we are left with a conjunc tion of unformul statement about the creativ power of natur or the law of harmoni and appeal to author ancient wisdom 
as evan 1994 point out west magic system is a close system 
w e are invit to bcheve that it is true not becaus it con nect up with other thing which experi has shown to be true but by some inher truth of it own which will have it that the planet saturn symbol contract wherea jupit symbol expans 


p 413 
while in general astrolog pretend that claim about zochac sign hous planetari aspect and so on are empir statement that is claim capabl of be reject or modifi by research or theori to most astrolo ger such claim actual function as necessarili true claim 
the truth of central astrolog tenet themselv is never in doubt 
a more general under issu here is whi astrolog themselv behev in astrolog 
as dean mather and kell 1996 point out the step in bef are rough 1 read astrolog book becom awar o r h e system 
2 learn more calcul chart see that they appear to work 
3 becom dazzl by the histori majesti and sheer appeal of it all 
4 adopt the sys the origin of astrolog idea a legitim queri here concern how these astrolog connect were establish in the first place 
to make it easier let us initi consid a relat straightforward astrolog claim and examin the theori ad vanc by astrolog to explain the origin of these connect 
if astrolo ger have no plausibl explan then we have good reason to reject more complic claim base on these connect 
accord to traltion astrolog the planet are suppos to be asso ciat with certain charact trait for exampl mar is associ with com bativ and courag and uranus is associ with origin and ind pendenc 
how did astrolog find this out or determin this 
g a u q u e h 1980 and startup 1981 have describ five such theori that are taken serious by member of the astrolog communiti 
ln what 1046 i w kelli follow i w d describ each of these theori reli heavili on mani of the insight of startup to examin them critic 1 the planetari connect were reveal to the ancient by a higher intellig for exampl by god angel demon or extraterrestri 
apart from beg the question about the exist of these be in the first place explain mysteri in term of other mysteri doe not take us ani further than we were befor 
we have not explain how these alien got their knowledg and so it mere push the problem elsewher startup p 26 
it is also not clear how this propos could be independ test 
2 the earli astrolog acquir this inform about planet and personti by paranorm mean 
this similar beg the question in that it assum esp has been demonstr and is capabl of establish relat ship far and beyond the claim of the major of even the most fervent advoc of the paranorm 
also which parricular psi abil is to be invok 
sure telepathi is not good here sinc prior to the esrablish of the typolog there was no one mind to read 
clairvoy is equal du bious sinc it is difficult to imagin what state of affair could have been paranorm per ceiv which was not avail to ordinari percept 
that leav precognit 


but this would presum requir that the ancient astrolog somehow saw the result of modern in vestigauon which were themselv in turn inspir albeit indirect by the insight of the ancient startup 1981 p 26 
there are other problem 
what is the it we are detect by paranorm mean 
some forc eman from the celesti object 
how do the item detect paranorm relat to item detect by normal percept 
for exampl if we detect all sort of paranorm ray around us how can we tell that they are come from what we visual perceiv as mar 
how do we know that there is a correl between the normal and the paranorm item 
by paranorm meansthat doubli question beg 
by normal mean 
if so then whi could not we have notic the paranorm item through normal channel 
psycholog astrolog involv four fundament claim 
the first two are common to other h d s of astrolog name that there is a correl between celesti and terrestri phenomena and that everyth in the birth chart affect everyth els in the birth 
the third and fourth claim are the unusu one name that the birth chart indic not behavior or event but chang in conscious and that astrolog should be view in the perspect of a magic organ worldview 
a look at these four claim can now be taken one by one 
1 
relationship postul by astrolog between celesti phenomena and terrestri phenomena are onli correl 
tradit astrolog usual adopt the notion that the relationship between celesti and terrestri affair was some h d of causal one 
as placidus said in 1657 it is imposs for the effici heaven caus as be so veri far distant from thing below to influenc sublunari bode unless by some rnedum or instrument virtu 


the instrument caus of the star is light and the star where they do not rise are inact so astrolog should reject a secret influenc as superflu nay even im possibl p 1 3 
most modern astrolog reject this causal approach 
per ry 1994 tell us that the relat between peopl and their birth chart are not causal but correl 
the astronom bode reflect human life exp rienc rather hke a mirror reflect a landscap which has to be inter prete 
but there is much disagr over the kind of celesti configura tion that are relev and how they are to be interpret 
in fact no matter what an astrolog may claim a search of the literatur vjlu invari find a conflict claim 
this dsagreement exist even at the most fundament lev el for entir popul of astrolog for exampl western astrolog dis agre with eastern astrolog on which zodiac to use and how mani planet to use 
this lack of agreement is widespread within western astrolog itself ln horari astrolog answer question eg should i marri x 
the moon north node is a point of illfortun but in humanist astrolog it is the direct of person growth jone 1996 
such system are mutual incompat yet are seen as complet vahd by their user 
tern as true and reject attack to avoid cognit disson 
the sequenc from 1 to 4 is not unreason 
student of astrolo y are not told to accept astrolo without question they are told ro tri thin s out for themsefv so at first sight what c o u l b efair 
the roblem of cours is that ley are nor made awar of all the pidal of person valtdat ancfth coneir mation bias nor are they told how to make control test or to design research that actual test astrolog hy othes and not auxiliari hypothes 
nor are they present the vast bodi of critic oe astroog tenet as is for exampl found in h i s artic e and refer 
onc they reach 4 then ani intern inconsist and disagr can lo ical be accomrno date as minor hiccu s due to the complex of astrolog or inevit fuman fallibl see dean mather e f 1996 1044 i w 
kelli astrolog meanlng of astrolog sign and hous are not veri clear cut and there are no agre upon rule for weigh their effect 
for exam ple as the astrolog prudenc jone 1996 p 282 say the zodiac sign rest on shaki foundat from the modern point of view 
how in heaven do twelv 30 sector of the eclipt measur from the vernal equinox but name after now fardist constel impart ani qualiti at all to the planet hous part and node which we view against their background 
do they do so in fact or is this wish think 
some astrolog justdi the sign take u s u d y without explan the sun in the sign as their exemplar as shorthand for season characterist 
but this impli that their order should be revers in the southern hemispher which seldom happen 
and what in ani case of horoscop for equatori latitud where season chang is minim but where of cours astrolog was invent 
the mean of sign depend upon which zodiac is use and the mean of hous depend on which hous system is use 
hous system differ with regard to number sequenc method of divis and interpret mar ten trachet 1995 
western astrolog also dlffer in how mani planet should be use some use undiscov hypothet planet other use as teroid dean mather 1977 
this dversiti in fundament give us grould to be sceptic of claim that astrolog are speakmg about some thirthey have actual apprehend 
2 
the horoscop is a whole syslem in which everi part is influenc by everi other part 
astrolog factor cannot be examin in isol the whole birth chart is need 
so the golden rule is that onli the whole chart should be consid for ani astrolog purpos whatev dwyer 1985 p 1 
as perri point out 


no one part of a horoscop can be isol 


sinc everyth influenc everyth els and 


you cannot empir ob serv a pure astrolog factor isol from other factor in the chart perri 1993 p 6 
but astrolog disagre over which individu factor are import so they dsagre over what the whole chart consist they just agre that whatev it is it is import to keep it in mind when do as trolog 
as the psychologist jan van rooij 1994 ask where doe the whole chart end 
with ten planet rwelv sign twelv hous midpoint ar abic point node aspect and whatev other astrolog concept may be use it is simpli imposs to interpret a whole chart 
when astrolog claim that they use the whole chart they onli refer to the fact that they use more factor than just one 
nevertheless no matter how mani factor they may use they alway use a restrict nzrrmber of factor and therefor onli a part of the horoscop 
they neuer use the whole chart 
but then the question becom how mani factor would be consid and which factor 


suppos that i consid as mani as 20 fac tor then undoubt an astrolog will come up who claim that i should use 21 factor p 56 ital mine 
the whole chart therefor has a differ mean to differ school of astrolog 
some astrolog use asteroid in birth chart 
as hand modern astrolog a critiqu 1045 1981 point out size of an astronom bodi is unrel to astrolog effect therefor tlhe lsaster is that there are thousand of aster oid and other minor bode orbit the sun and use presentday astro logic techniqu there is no way of account for all of them in a chart p 93 
other astrolog use hypothet planet such as vulcan that have not been detect by astronom hand 1981 p 95 
there is no evid that astrolog use asteroid or hypothet planet are more insight or more success counsellor than those use incomplet chart or nona trolog orient psychotherapist or even lay therapist dean 1985 mc grew mcfall 1992 
how can dlfferent set of part give the same meaning whole 
this problem would seem to be exacerb when we rememb that conflict western astrolog uthz differ factor and even when the same factor are use they are often weight differ 
if differ school of astrolog use differ astrolog factor and henc oper with ddferent notion of the whole chart then ani refer to the suppos common of the whole chart is less than meaning 
perri state everi planet and everi sign of the z o l a c is influenc by the whole in which it is embed 1995 p 34 
but if my whole chart and your whole chart involv factor that are ddferent in type or number the end result must accord to per ry be open to question 
it is as if we thought we were take about the same thing but upon investig found that i meant volkswagen while you were refer to cadillac 
so when we are told by astrolog that astrolog work we are not sure what to make of it 
it is like be told that you will surviv your de mise in some form by ddferent rehgion and have littl idea how this wdl be accomplish 
wlliyou be a disembodi spirit a resurrect bodi an as tral bodi or even come back as a mosquito etc 
someproblem o f modern astrolog idea 3 astrolog predict changer in conscious not behavioor event 
it is here that the new psycholog astrolog depart from tradit 
here the relationship between celesti pattern and human be is not with outward observ pattern of behavior and tendenc but rather with the unobserv inner me of a person or what perri call the psi chic structur which under person perri 1995b p 123 see also perri 1988 
he said a horoscop symbol the complex evolv narur of conscious 
the depth of per sonal 
the dynam relat between psycholog drive

perri 1995b p 124 
zodiac sign symbol general 


fundament human need or motiva tional drive inher in the human condit perri 1988 p i wherea the hous posit and planetari aspect symbol a particular inlvidu map of conscious or inborn person structur perri 1988 p 2 3 
the extrem problem of account for the relat between celesti factor and observ relat specif outcom postul by the trad tional astrolog are further exacerb by the psycholog astrolog ad dtional conjectur 
how do we know such invis psycholog process underli the astrolog symbol 
perri state such cognit process and structur are distd from the composit descript associ with tradit astrolog symbol 
for exampl 


the need of a zodiac sign can be infer from the behavior which is characterist of that sign eg leonian pride creativ and aniabilityevid the univers human need for vabdat of perceiv ident perri 
1988 p 2 
it is ddficult to see how it follow in the f i s t place from the charact istic behavior of a sign that one intrins motiv factor tie them all togeth and even if the case could be made a further case would need to be independ made for the particular human drive postul by perri 
h e never clear set out how he arriv at these conclus 
no set of studl of a quantit or qualit natur are discuss nor is there ani kind of an appeal to ani care examin of the astrolog symbol behavior by independ astrolog or psychologist to determin what t w o harbing and precursor of modern astrop cholog are dane and rudhyar and alan leo 
in the earl rwentiech centuri the british astrofog leo inect theosophist and mystic idea into astrolgi 
the move away from tradit idea in d e unit state was begun by rudhyar and his humanist astrolog orient dure the third decad of the centuri 
in their inner orient rudhyar and perri overlap the main differ be that rudhyar is more i n c h e d to eastern mystic and rehgion 
a critic examin of rudhyar idea can be found in kelli and krutzen 1983 
1052 i w kelli one might infer from them 
furthermor if onli the whole chart will do in ferenc base on part are by definit meaningless 
perri elev psycholog astrolog to miracl status by further in form us that the dynam relat between various psycholog drive symbol by the horoscop are fluid and chang vari in accord with situat specif development age emot matur and level of psycholog integr 1995b p 123 1994 p 34

un like the boundari of physic object the content and process of con scious involv mean whose boundari region are fuzzi 



mlean ing are indefinit arbitrari relat and cultur embed perri 1995a p 34 
the psycholog astrolog claim these incredbl complex chang amorph inner complex which may not even be conscious have been infer from cluster of behavior associ with astrolog symbol 
it is clear that no theori of conscious base on physic process can perform the role demand so perri opt for dualism the exist of a nonphys immateri mind 
while psycholog astrolog was describ as a theori of extraordinari complex and a model of conscious perri 1995a p 32 1994 p 33 epistemolog question regard this dualist view of conscious were never address we are mere offer tidbit such as conscious is a nonphys system 1995a p 32 and a subject experi of awar that has no materi correl 

1995a p 34 
nowher d perri articul the intrins natur of his ver sion of the nonphys mind 
it is also far from clear how the postul of a soulnonphys mind can contribut toward clarlfylng and inform our understand of central notion such as purpos behavior valu intern selfcaus mean and creativ over that offer by contemporari model consist with materi such as those offer by flanagan 1992 searl 1992 crick 1994 penros 1994 dennett 1996 
neither doe he offer us ani inkl as to the mediat role the nonphys mind play be tween cosmos and psychic structur 
sinc psycholog astrolog doe not have a theori of it own regard ing the natur and structur of the inner psycholog process suppos mirror by planetari configur it rest m a d y on those postul by modern psychodynam theori 
more specif perri relat the birth chart horoscop to conscious and unconsci process area of repr sion and conflict pathway of sublim transfer dynam projec tion and the lke perri 1995b p 123 see also perri 1988 
even if we contend that psycholog astrolog have refin the crude approxima tion of the tradit astrolog who do not offer plausibl scenario of how their correl were establish this case is veri difficult to make 
the reason is simpl 
twentieth centuri theoriz was influenc by a great modern astrolog a critiqu 1053 varieti of area of research includ investgaton into brain function hu manist and existenti school of psycholog artifici intellig physic ism and functionahsm in philosophi and so on 
ancient mediev and re naissanc theori of mind uthz by the astrolog of the past were quit ddferent 
and to complic the pictur further as philosoph of scienc such as thoma kuhn 1970 have point out when new paradigm come and go the same or similar term often acquir new mean 
for exampl the contemporari term motion and matter were also use by aristotl with ddferent interconnect and mean 
therefor perri claim that there is near uniform agreement base on centuri of observ as to the mean of astrolog symbol 1993 p 7 is clear problemat in light of the histor disagr over the natur and constitu of the mind 
consid also the psycholog astrolog claim that inner mental dy namic can be express in a great varieti of way 
here they reject as sim plistic the tradit astrolog claim that celesti pattern are typic as sociat with relat specif outcom 
but in rnakmg this reject they step from the fri pan into the volcano becaus it further increas the alreadi imposs complex of possibl associ 
as an exampl of this new complex the british astrolog charl harvey 1995 claim the same planetari combin can express itself in a whole rang of way 
for exam ple uranus in hard aspect with the midpoint of sun and kloon may produc a napoleon or a hitler but equal it may produc a margaret thatcher d s p k em d i g a n a martin luther or a particular spiritu caring1 astrolog such as dr zip dobyn p 52 
similar perri claim that the psycholog astrolog doe not pre dtct specif behavior or life outcom but rather predict qualttat exp rienc of conscious that can be reflect in a varieti of manifest perri 1994 p 34 1995a p 34 
h e affirm that the mean of the part may be stabl but the emerg qualiti they r o d u c ewhen com bine are not becaus real peopl are chang evolv entiti that are far too complex to type or tag with a few simpl key word perri 1993 p 7 
ln other word accord to perri and harvey the birth chart accu rate show our under subject process but as to their outward manifest astrolog can onli guess at a rang of possibl happen 
the inner psychic state is shown in the birth chart but after that just about anyth goe 
as perri said we all have the potenti to behav in ani way that is human possibl and we frequent do 1995a p 36 
we can see that the psycholog astrolog is worlung with a challeng ing system 
to start with it involv celesti configur that can never be examin in isol and whose varieti when combin is immens larger than anyon could possibl cope with 
nevertheless the planetari 1054 i w kelli configur suppos correl with an invis larg unconsci psychlc structur that under person and that is associ with out come so vari and so uncertain that the astrolog can onli make guess 
final this psychic structur is base on psychoanalyt and humanist psi cholog theori that sinc the 1950s have come under veri heavi criti cism 
10 if this critic is success then psycholog astrolog in it pres ent form will go down with the ship eg see macmdan 1991 esterson 1993 grunbaum 1993 kerr 1993 spenc 1994 webster 1995 crew 1996 dean 1996a 
after all if the psycholog structur symbol by the planet and their interrelationship is problemat the rest of the theori is on shaki ground 
4 
astrolog can onli be appropri evalu in a magic animist worldview 
tradit astrolog emphas the prehction of event the associa tion of relat spechc observ outcom with astrolog factor sometim with the view that planet are transmitt of physic influenc 
thus the client of the famous 17 centuri astrolog wdlam l1uy ex pect predict and decis make not psycholog and rehgion 
such an orient is not advers to experiment investig 
a main problem for this approach as perri acknowledg is that the vast major of studi have not support such claim perri 1995a 
further there is no prospect that plausibl physic hkage wdl be discov that explain astrolog associ with human activ perri 1995a pp 
2633 culver ianna astrolo er are forev tri to increas the surfac plausibl of astrolog b associ it with theqatest theori that have caught the public imagin 
so l u m e n t h i 1 9 9 4 p 19 appeal to the relev of fuzzi logic to astrolog while perri allud to chao theori 1994 p 34 and the new physic exemplifi by fritjof capra and david bohm 
townley 1994 inform us that the more advanc area of system mathemat complex theori inform theori and neurosci could be veri friend to the type of structur think that the best of astrolog has to offer and to which astrolog could make import contribu tion p 43 
tewsburi 1988 note how rupert sheldrak g c i p l e o€ format causauon should remov the object that astrolog is imposs ad g m an interest circular that astrolog r s d fis a further poinrer to it truth

we are not provid specif of how these juxtaposit wdl take place

1996 for critic comment on misinterpret of quantum me chanic by advoc of new age claim 
further such modern approach in ysic do not explain whi the planetari posit of a moment in the past birth describ suppos continu natur of a person in the present

in the past the same confid was express by s everi promin theori of the time 
the two millennia of failur provid a s t o l o e rwith some good induct ground for believ that the confid of presentday astrolog is as misplnc as that of their predecessor

l2 perri 1995a state the worldview need to make sens of as trolog must involv a sacr realm that unit order and anim the cosmos p 19 or what west call a system of magic 1991 p 223 and cornelius 1994 p 19 call some other element that is other than delus and esp 
the metaphys perspect propos by perri reintro duce ancient notion of teleolog causat occult power of attract psychospiritu explan and most import the notion that psych and cosmos are alik and correspond through symbol actionatadist 1995a pp 
1516 
further perri explain this will involv a return at least in part to belief that were common in prescientif cultur in which a world soul or conscious was imman in all part of the univers 
the univers so conceiv involv a hierarchi with part interconnect by sympathet reson 
astrolog play a larg part in such worldview becaus it gave peopl a symbol languag for understand the various mean and correspond of natur phenomena perri 1995a p 15 also 1993 p 2 
perri and most other western astrolog tend to avoid specif when describ their animist worldview 
lstead we are provid sprin h g s of opaqu term and express such as law of reson spiritu realiti the soul the sacr occult caus and inher power to attract other thing 
while most of us have some familiar with such term it is unlik that we could give a coher account of them 
so an explic of astrolog theori should explain these central element 
but instead of clarif we are offer evas such as astrolog seem to belong to some other order of know thing bare conceiv in the modern the astrolog potteng 1994 said oppon of astrolog like to quot extraordinari claim requir extraordinari proof without give ani roof that as abov so below is an ex traordinari c l a h 
it is onli extraordinari in some h o s o p l u e sespeci 
materxaib frame work which den mean p 37 
as it stand w at potteng state is trival true 
whal euer is ostulateibar logic im ossibilitiesl is more plausibl within some worldview than o k r s 
for exampl fairi b u b b l oblin and guardian angel are extraordinari claim in materialist concept of the world and perhap mani ocher as well but this alon doe not provid ani reason to believ in cheir exist 
the claim that the univers has mean and provid us with sign or portent doe not impli that the sign are to be found up there they might onli be found in entrail the track and movement of natur or onli in messag from angel or similar be or in a number of other form 
it doe not follow that an animisticmag univers nust have or even might have mean reflect everywher 
w e need cogent reason to prefer the animist univers of astrolog to ocher possibl animist univers and furthermor evid for a particular as trolog system than other altern 
there are also an incred larg number of ossibl pair between as abov so below 
the possibl are even larger for a system eas on the symbol mean of si ns for exampl there are probabl more possibl pair of two thing in say jungian symol ism than if we confii o u n d v e s to putat causal materi r d a t i o n s h i so it is even more incumb on astrolog to provid a reason whi they connect two t lngs cogeth than it would be for a materiahsc 
thed t v e r sofi astrolog world view societi that did possess what we would recogn as a form of astrol ogi were associ with worldview that differ radcal in their concep tion regardmg the natur of ultim realiti their basic hierarch struc ture the mode of divin activ and whether the divin natur was per sonal or nonperson the natur of the self the destini of human be and so on 
likewis the associ astrolog often differ from each oth er along essenti dimens 
for exampl the circumpolar star the pole star and the quadrant vision of the sky uthz in chines astrolog are use differ in western astrolog 
the circl of 12 anim in chines as trolog bear littl resembl to the western zodiac 
the ascend is irn portant in western astrolog but not in chines astrolog and so on cul ver lama 1988 p 25 dean mather kelli 1996 pp 
5657 
in lndia there are also a number of astrolog system which conhct both with each other and with western approach see premanand bhatti risbud 1993 for an overview and critiqu of i n l a n astrolog 
in the dashapaddhati system the name of the planet are written in a sequenc that is not onli arbitrari from a western astrolog perspect but is also not relat to ani physic characterist of the planet or their lstanc from the earth 
each planet is alleg to have a certain period of influenc over the destini of peopl 
these period vari from 6 year to 20 year 
each planet take control over a person destini in the order specifi by the system and the durat assign to them 
the sequenc of the planet is the same for all peopl provid you are follow the vinshotiari 120 year system 
on the other hand if an astrolog use the ashtottari dasha system the last four planet appear in a revers order and togeth have a 1058 i w kelli differ durat of 108 year 
dure one lifetim the same planet can not take charg of your destini again unless you live for more than 120 year or 108 year 
both of these mutual exclus system are satisfi to the astrolog themselv and to their client 
when we turn to the mayan of the america other fundament dif ferenc in worldview along with astrolog differ emerg 
in term of hierarch structur and ahe astrolog the mayan cosmolog was quit differ from the orbitalthem earthbr suncent idea of other cultur 
for a start mayan astrolog assign a veri central role for venus 
ln addtion the posit of venus relat to the horizon was contrari to western astrolog more import for the mayan than it movement 
they also associ the morn and even appear of venus with lunar phase and eclips which have no counterpart in other astrolog sys tem 
final astrolog in mayan me was closer to the astrolog of ina and tradit western astrolog than perri vision in that the central focus was divin and propheci aveni 1992 danien sharer 1992 
astrolog symbol is magic think while the astronom and mathemat base of the cosmolog and astrolog develop by the mesopotanian chines mayan and 1ndian cul ture were sophist the mean or qualiti ascrib to planetari con junction and movement were depend on the religi and mytholog belief of the particular societi in question 
this explain whi mani of the physic characterist of the celesti bodi size distanc etc 
are consid ere irrelev with regard to their effect or mean or even whether a planetari bodi actual exist eg vulcan becaus what matter is the sym bolism or mytholog attach to the bodi name 
the influenc effect or correl attribut to the planetari configur are base on a prior1 endem magic correspond reli on superfici sidar and analog 
for exampl the mediev astrologerphysician william of en gland appeal to the magic doctrin of k e affect k e as have astrolo ger of all period 
henc he argu 


the sun and mar affect red bile becaus all three are hot and the moon and venus affect phlegm becaus they are cold and should the hot and dri mar be caus a disturb of the blood then when mar move into a hous that has a dsturbanc of the chest the patient d spit blood french 1996 p 478 
the modern astrolog davidson 1963 state without the sun there would be no life 
venus was wide believ at the time to be a cold planet wherea mar was character as hot and dri 
hoth coldc wetw and dryd were the four �ualiti underlyin the four ele ment consid by greek philosoph to be the basic constituenr of the pysic world name earthcd airhw fire hd watercw 
element with common quahti were abl to chang inro each other eg water cw could chang into earth cd becaus both includ the modern astrolog a critiqu 1059 it is the drive forc behind the whole solar system 
it represenr will power vital leadership creativ 


p 29 and the ring of saturn symbol the hitat impos by saturnian action that oper as a harsh extern disciph until we have learnt to disciph ourselv p 32 
the practic of present day astrolog give addtionalground for the independ of their symbol from ani observ or testabl theori base 
whenev a newli discov astronom bodi is found the attribu tion of it earth connect is not base on the result of publish inv tigat with extens public discuss to establish it relationship with world affair 
rather if the name can be identifi eg by look it up in dictionari of mytholog and could be plausibl relat to exist plan etari mytholog not difficult then the result will be long articl in astrol ogyjournalsbi author surf the mytholog wave where reader will be move to tear or to outrag by the beauti and insight of the connect 
when pluto was discov in 1939 and chiron in 1977 a minor planet or moon between the orbit of saturn and uranus astrolog did not publish research to establish their relationship with human and world affair 
plu to is given as one might expect from mytholog a malef influenc on hu man me 
as davidson 1963 state the planet name after the god of hade repres the underworld of man conscious those element in his natur that have not been redeem 


p 33 
could it be otherwis 
it is difficult to imagin that astrolog would ever inform us that a planet name pluto would be associ with love of me and fellow human be ing sensit and lea sure ilk venus 
similar hand 1981 remark chiron is believ by mani to have a connect with consciousexpand ing teach and with initi into higher conscious p 94 
in the case of chiron as with pluto these relationship are those we would expect astrolog to attribut to them if they were base entir on mytholog cdver ianna 1988 
similar as the astrolog press 1993 said about asteroid 


the particular mytholog whether greek roman egyptian etc is relev to the express of the asteroid in the birth chart p 178 
what happen here is that have determn the asteroid mytholog the astrolog look at the asteroid positoneg by sign by hous by aspect in various peopl chart to see if there 1s anyth in the person or case histori that could match the interpret of that posit 
for exampl the as teroid icarus repres fli too close to the sun 
the posit hous of cold 
most greek scholar of cours consid scienc as we know it roda ro be an insignific part of philosophi which meant that their world view was base m a d y on hilosoph ideal rather than empir observ 
so hot and cold etc 
do not nece sarfi correspond to what we today call hor and cold etc 
1060 i w kelli sign numer and exact aspect of icarus w d show where a person wlll take risk p 197 
whenev possibl some astrolog will add physic symbol to the mytholog symbol 
for exampl the orbit of icarus is between the sun and jupit 
this contain surround icarus with the irradi of the sun and the expans of jupit 
icarus orbit is in and cross the orbit of mercuri venus the earth and mar 
be in those orbit give icarus a smatter of the restless of mercuri the sensuous of venus the earthi of the earth and the selfa sertiv of mar press 1993 p 
1961 
what happen if the new astronom bodi are name after modern indi vidual 
startup 1981 said a popular modern astrolog doctrin maintain that newli discov planet are inevit given appropri name from which the correct terrestri relationship can be infer even though the name are bestow by astronom nowaday 
this is usual taken as one more exampl of synchron p 33 
asteroid without classic name have a special lund of import again base pure on symbol consider 
here we enter the realm of person name asteroid 
press 1993 p 212 conclud after much un control research that if an asteroid has your name or someth close to it then it posit in your horoscop describ your relationship to yourself whatev that mean 
if an asteroid has the name of anoth person eg asteroid 3085 is call donna then it posit in your horoscop birth chart describ your relationship to that person 
this would seem to impli that your relationship to all the donna in the world would have much in common 
along the same line magic or unknown influenc are appeal to whenev astrolog is in ddficulti 
earlier in this articl p 1044 the prob lem of includmg all the asteroid in the birth chart or horoscop was de scribe 
hand 1981 point out that astrolog eleanor bach solv the problem by use just the first four asteroid to be discov 
hand 1981 justifi this arbitrari choic by inform us that one way of defend the use of the first four to be discov rather than the four largest is to say that the effect of celesti bodi is in some way relat to human conscious of them rather chan to their physic properti 
as the first to be discov they no doubt made a greater impact chan the thousand later to be discov p 93 
the divers of symbol use b astrolog with ap arent no rule about be consi rent is noteworthi 
davidson 1963 lase his a s t r o o i c a mbolism fs various on physic at tribut of the planet and on attribut of che g r e e k g d s 
he a t m l o p yr s 1993 
on the other hand uthz other mytholog and add ano er d m e n s o no physic characterist to her symbol such as a celesti bodi proxim to other celesti bodi 
which particular magic correspond are perceiv as relev are in the eye of the behold and there are mani dfierent astrolog behold 
modern astrolog a critiqu 1061 such specul have the great advantag of requir no argument and the disadvantag of say noth 
we are left in the dark as to what the some way relat and greater impact are intend to mean here 
what about peopl who have never heard of the first four asteroid 
doe this mean the asteroid cannot be use in construct their chart or doe the awar of academ of their exist cover for the rest of us 
no doubt anoth set of special rule can be devis by astrolog to solv this problem 
some of the grave ddficulti of magic correspond as explana tion were describ by dean loptson and kelli 1996 first magic correspond are argument from analog which can be express in the form object x has properti a and b object y has properti a therefor y also has b john smith is tall therefor john brown is tall 
the infer is vivid and quick and therefor as in astrolog agreeabl seduct but our chang of it be correct are not good 


no longer do midwiv open the door to eas a pain labour 
no longer do alchem idea ap pear in chemistri cours 
in fact magic correspond have been so spectacular unsuc cess that in western educ today the doctrin surviv onli as an exampl of fallaci thinlung 
second it is imposs to spec ani nvo thing no matter how dissimilar that do not show some kind of correspond 
a raven is like a write desk becaus both begin with the r sound both cast shadow both contain qud 
a speck of sand is like the empir state build becaus h e y have the same color both contain shca and have the same number of atom as brick 

the point is how can we distinguish a magic correspond from other correspond 
the book do not td us 
third we have no immedi way of choos be tween oppos magic correspond 
black cat were lucki ro ancient egyptian but un lucki to mediev european 
the moon was male to the babylonian but femal to the greek 



is mar unfortun becaus redblood war or fortun becaus redblood life 
who can believ ani magic correspond when it is so easili deni by anoth 
pp 
2829 
other critic of magic thlnking can be found from a philosoph view point by thagard 1980 and from a psycholog perspect by zusn and jone 1989 
conclus the argument given in this articl show that account put forward by astrolog for the origin and justif of postul celesti relationship with outward behavior or activ of human be tradit astrolog or inner structur of conscious modern psycholog astrolog are problemat and implaus in the extrem 
we can conclud that astrolog as present practic is not a sourc of inform or knowledg about ourselv 
anomali and problem do not result in construct attempt to revis the conceptu basi of astrolog or extend it in way that would allow astrolog to learn from failur as they do in orthodox disciplin mayo 1996 
rather they are dealt with by the use of metaphor that lead nowher and constant shking ad hoc hy 1062 i w kelli pothes that are not independ testabl 
confirm are readili attribut as support but failur can be hidden in the complex of astrol ogi and never need confront ani specif astrolog hypothes 
henc the general indiffer of astrolog to negat evid mayo 1996 pp 
280282 kelli 1997 
but astrolog rhetor hyperbol and bluff are not adequ ground for claim of knowledg see dean loptson 1996 for other conceptu critic of astrolog 
the failur of physic model to provid an underpin for astrolog cal tenet has result in a shift to more animist magic worldview 
while astrolog is more plausibl within such worldview it is so onli in the banal sens that such framework provid fewer constraint on what may be postul than modern scientif formul of the world 
the appeal to magic worldview allow astrolog postul to overrid or side step ani physic law that may conbct evan 1994 
astrolog who advoc such worldview do not provid articul posit capabl of construct evalu and improv but rather couch their frame work in term of a hodgepodg of spiritualloccult express along with pass refer to modern physic and ed disciph to appear con temporari and fashion 
these occult convolut eg anim spir it sympathi 
pure conscious reson bond of vibratori frequen cie psychic anatomi etc are not ascrib properti to be of ani use explanatori valu 
we are left with a sparat set of idea taken out of con text from various often incompat ancient worldview juxtapos without ani coher interlock metaphys 
astrolog as current practic doe not have ani plausibl observa tional or theoret basi for the groundmg of it particular claim dean loptson kelli 1996 
there is littl agreement on what astrolog fac tor should be consid in a birth chart that is what factor can be ig nore and how they should be combin or even consensus regard how to collect relev data to resolv even the most basic astrolog dlspute dean mather 1996 
astrolog consequ doe not have the concep tual resourc to deal with it own anomali or to benefit from or contrib ute to find in other field such as psycholog or biolog in ani way other than by arbitrari mean and sophistri 
the basi and structur of as trolog is entir base on cultur specif mytholog and symbol in a magic context 
astrolog is part of our past but astrolog have given no plausibl reason whi it should have a role in our futur

o psycholog report 1997 modern astrolog a critiqu i w kelli univers of saskatchewan cazada summaryastrolog as present practic in either it tradiuon or psycho logic form has no relev to understand ourselv or our place in the cosmos 
modern advoc of astrolog cannot account for the under basi of astrolog associ with terrestri affair have no plausibl explan for it claim and have not contribut anyth of cognit valu to ani field of the social scienc 
further astrolog doe not have the theoret or conceptu resourc to resolv it own intern problem adequ or extern anomali or to adjud among con flict astrolog claim or system 
the initi assumpt of scientist and astrolog were not so veri differ until quit re centli 
some astrolog howev fear that scienc was catch up to them have back track veri rapid c r e a h g a smokescreen of symbol inner realiti holist understand etc 
arthur mather 1979 p 106 in western cultur until newton the view of astrolog and scientist were not so veri differ 
there was general belief that all phenomena in the inferior element world of natur were govern in some way by the motion of the superior and incorrupt celesti bodi 
sinc newton howev the view of astrolog and scientist have becom increas oppos 
astrolog today stdl hold that the connect between celesti and earth phenomena is so strong that know one allow us to predict the other 
but scientist disagre 
they point out that there is no plausibl way the connect could work or even a plausibl theori of how it could work 
survey of research into astrolog have provid no evid that astrolog doe work at least not in the way and to the extent claim by astrolog 
of cours everi time we wake up with the sun or plan barb cue on m o o d t night or go fish at high tide we are show how cele tial bodi have real influenc in our live but this is veri differ from the connect clame by astrolog

similar nia and dean 1986 point out no bodi should be surpris to learn that the hardest thing to find in astrolog are fact p 357 
but if you know where to look they can certain be found 
befor 1950 veri few scientif studi of astrolog exist 
someth h e a dozen major statist compil by astrolog had appear sinc 1900 notabl in franc germani england and the usa but none were wide known and in ani case their methodolog was too poor eg no control for meaning result 
not surpris the few publish critiqu were confin most to histor survey eg thomen 1938 bok mayal 1941 eisler 1946 
the onli extens scientif critiqu avail was by the french astronom paul couderc 19511974 
then in 1955 michel g a u q u e h publish his landmark llnfluenc des astr the first rigor studi of astrolog claim with general negat result but with what seem to be provoc except gauqueh 1955 
dure the next two decad various factor combin to establish a small but continu interest in astrolog research name the boom popular interest in astrolog further work by gauquelin eg 1966 1969 the occasion astrologyrel paper in a scientif journal and not least by astrolog themselv found researchori bodl such as the astro logic associ uk in 1958 and the intern societi for astrolog cal research usa in 1970 
the result was a notabl increas in the number of critic studi 
ln the 1970s there appear various critiqu of the occult that in clude astrolog eg freedland 1972 cooper 1974 sladek 1974 cazeau scott 1979 and critiqu devot entir to astrolog eg parker 1970 russel 1972 gallant 1974 dean mather 1977 jerom 1977 standen 1977 kelli 1979 
the last was the first comprehens critic review of as trolog scientif research base 
it took seven personyear to prepar sur vey mani hundr of book and articl and document over 150 em piric stucb publish in astrolog journal and over twenti publish in psycholog journal dean mather 1977 
by 1996 new studl and pre viousli miss studi had brought these total to about 300 and 70 respec tive dean nia french 1997 
the research interest that dean and mather 1977 stimul led to the foundat in 1981 of correl an intern peerreview journal devot entir to scientif research into astrolog follow in 1982 by astropsycholog problem orient more toward gauquelin interest 
by then the advent of home comput in the late 1970s had revolution astrolog practic and research 
calcul a birth chart onc took ani where from an hour to a day now it could be done in second allow modern astrolog a critiqu 1037 research to do studi that were previous unthink 
today there is a scholar research base that cover most of the basic claim of astrolog 
even sun slgn column have been test 
the outcom from all this in what probabl amount to well over two hundr personyear of research is al most uniform negat dean mather kelli 1996

chaucer’ astronomi 27 v astrolog lore in chaucer 51 appendix 79 pg 3 astronom lore in chaucer i astronomi in the middl age the conspicu of astronom lore in the poetri of chaucer is due to it import in the life of his centuri 
in the mediaev period astronomi or ‘astrology’ for the two name were use indiffer to cover the same subject was one of the vital interest of men 
the ordinari man of the middl age knew much more than do most men today about the phenomena of the heaven conveni such as clock almanac and chart repres celesti phenomena were rare and direct observ of the appar movement and the relat posit of the heaven bodi were necessari for the regul of man’ daili occup 
furthermor the belief in a geocentr system of the univers which in chaucer’ centuri was almost univers accept was of vast signific in man’ way of think 
accept this view all the heaven bodi seem to have been creat for the sole benefit of man inhabit the central posit in the univers their movement alway with refer to the earth as a center brought to man light heat chang of season—al the condit that made human life possibl on the earth 
not onli did the man of the middl age see in the regular movement of the celesti sphere the instrument by which god grant him physic exist but in the various aspect of heaven phenomena he saw the govern principl of his moral life 
the arrang of the heaven bodi with regard to one anoth at various time was suppos to exert undoubt power over the cours of terrestri event 
each planet was thought to have special attribut and a special influenc over men’spg 4 live 
venus was the planet of love mar of war and hostil the sun of power and honor and so forth 
each was mysteri connect with a certain color with a metal too the alchemist said and each had special power over some organ of the human bodi 
the planet’ influenc was believ to vari great accord to it posit in the heaven so that to determin a man’ destini accur it was necessari to consid the aspect of the whole heaven especi at the moment of his birth but also at other time 
this was call “cast the horoscope� and was regard as of great import in enabl a man to guard against threaten peril or bad tendenc and to make the best use of favor opportun 
it is not astonish then that the great monument of literatur in the mediaev period and even much later are fill with astronom and astrolog allus for these are but reflect of vital human interest of the time 
the greatest poetic work of the middl age dante’ divina commedia is rich in astronom lore and it dramat action is project against a cosmograph background reflect the view of dante’ contemporari as to the structur of the world 
milton write in the seventeenth centuri base the cosmolog of his paradis lost in the main on the ptolema system but make adam and the archangel raphael discuss the relat merit of this system and the heliocentr view of the univers 
the latter had been brought forth by copernicus a centuri earlier but even in milton’ day had not yet succeed in supplant the old geocentr cosmolog 
the view of the univers which we find reflect in chaucer’ poetri is chiefli base on the ptolema system of astronomi though it show trace of veri much more primit cosmolog idea 
the ptolema system owe it name to the famous alexandrian astronom of the second centuri a d claudius ptolemi but is base larg on the work and discoveri of the earlier greek philosoph and astronom especi eudoxus hipparchus and aristarchus whose investig ptolemi compiledpg 5 and along some line extend 
ptolema astronomi was a pure geometr or mathemat system which repres the observ movement and relat posit of the heaven bodi so accur that calcul as to their posit at ani given time could be base upon it 
ptolemi agre with his contemporari in the opinion that to assign caus for the celesti movement was outsid the sphere of the astronom 
this was a proper field of philosophi and the decis of philosoph especi those of aristotl were regard as final and their teach as the basi upon which observ phenomena should be describ 
accord to the ptolema system the earth is a motionless sphere fix at the center of the univers 
it can have no motion for there must be some fix point in the univers to which all the motion of the heaven bodi may be refer if the earth had motion it was argu this would be proportion to the great mass of the earth and would caus object and anim to fli off into the air and be left behind 
ptolemi believ this reason suffici to make unten the idea of a rotatori motion of the earth although he was fulli awar that to suppos such a motion of the earth would simplifi exceed the represent of the celesti movement 
it did not occur to him that to suppos the earth’ atmospher to particip in it motion would obviat this difficulti 
the earth was but a point in comparison with the immens sphere to which the star were attach and which revolv about the earth onc in everi twentyfour hour impart it motion to sun moon and planet thus caus day and night and the rise and set of the heaven bodi 
the irregular motion of the planet were account for by suppos them to move on circl of small sphere call ‘epicycles’ the centr of which move around the ‘deferents’ or circl of larg sphere which carri the planet in cours concentr to the star sphere 
by give each of the planet an epicycl and defer of the proper relat size and veloc the vari oscil of the planet as far as they could be follow by mean of the simpl instrument then in use were almost perfect account for 
pg 6though it was a pure mathemat system which onli attempt to give a basi for comput celesti motion ptolema astronomi is of great import histor as it remain the foundat of theoret astronomi for more than 1400 year 
throughout the long dark centuri of the middl age it surviv in the studi of the retir student of the monasteri and of the few except enlighten men who still had some regard for pagan learn in the day when mani of the church father denounc it as heret 
ptolemi was the last of the great origin greek astronom 
the alexandrian school produc after him onli copyist and comment and the theoret astronomi of the greek so high perfect in ptolemy’ almagest was for mani centuri almost entir neglect 
the roman state gave no encourag to the studi of theoret astronomi and produc no new school of astronomi 
although it was the fashion for a roman to have a smatter of greek astronomi and famous latin author like cicero seneca strabo and plini wrote on astronomi yet the roman care littl for origin investig and contribut noth new to the scienc 
the roman howev appreci the valu of astronomi in measur time and appli to the alexandrian school to satisfi their practic need for a calendar 
what julius caesar obtain from the alexandrian sosigen he great improv and gave to the empir as the calendar which with the except of the slight chang made by gregori xiii we still use 
the pseudoastronom scienc of astrolog or the socal ‘judici astronomy’ was pursu dure the roman empir and throughout the middl age with much greater zeal than theoret astronomi 
the interest in astrolog to be sure encourag the studi of observ astronomi to a certain extent for the cast of horoscop to foretel destini requir that the heaven bodi be observ and method of calcul their posit at ani time or place be known 
but there was no desir to inquir into the under law of the celesti motion or to investig the real natur of the heaven phenomena 
pg 7if the roman state did not encourag astronomi the roman church posit discourag it 
the bibl becam and long remain the sole author recogn by the church father as to the constitut of the univers 
by mani of the patrist ptolema astronomi was despis not becaus it did not describ accur the observ phenomena of the heaven for it did this in a way that could scarc have been improv upon with the facil for observ then avail and not becaus it was found upon the fals assumpt that the earth is the motionless center of the univers about which all heaven bodi revolv but becaus there was no author in scriptur for such a system and it could not possibl be made consist with the cosmolog of genesi 
allegor descript of the univers base on the scriptur held almost complet sway over the mediaev mind 
the whole univers was repres allegor by the tabernacl and it furnitur 
the earth was flat and rectangular like the tabl of shew bread and surround on all four side by the ocean 
the wall of heaven beyond this support the firmament shape like a halfcylind 
angel move the sun moon and star across the firmament and let down rain through it window from the expans of water abov 
ii chaucer’ scientif knowledg it was in the fourteenth centuri that chaucer live and wrote and his interest in astronom lore is therefor not surpris 
although the theori of astronomi current in chaucer’ centuri have been made unten by the de revolutionibus orbium of copernicus and by kepler’ discoveri of the law of planetari motion although the inaccur and unsatisfactori method of astronom investig then in use have been supplant by the better method made possibl through galileo’ invent of the telescop and through the modern use of spectrum analysi yet of all scientif subject the astronomi of that period could most near lay claim to the name of scienc accord to the present accept of the term 
for as we have seen the interest in astrolog dure the middl age had foster the studi of observ astronomi and thispg 10 in turn had furnish the scienc a basi of fact and observ far surpass in detail and accuraci that of ani other subject 
practic all of chaucer’ write contain some refer to the movement and relat posit of the heaven bodi and to their influenc on human and mundan affair and in some of his work especi the treatis on the astrolab a veri technic and detail knowledg of astronom and astrolog lore is display 
there is everi reason to suppos that so far as it satisfi his purpos chaucer had made himself familiar with the whole literatur of astronom scienc 
his familiar with ptolema astronomi is shown in his write both by specif mention1 of the name of ptolemi and his syntaxi common known as the ‘almagest’ and by mani more general astronom refer 
even more convinc evid of chaucer’ knowledg of the scientif literatur of his time is given in his treatis on the astrolab 
accord to skeat part i and at least twothird of part ii are taken with some expans andpg 11 alter from a work on the astrolab by messahala2 call in the latin translat which chaucer use “compositio et operatio astrolabie� this work may have been ultim deriv from a sanskrit copi but from chaucer’ own word in the prologu to the astrolabe3 it is clear that he made use of the latin work 
the rest of part ii may have been deriv from some general compendium of astronom and astrolog knowledg or from some other of the treatis on the astrolab which chaucer say were common in his time 
4 other sourc mention by chaucer in the astrolab are the calendar of john some and nichola lynn carmelit friar who wrote calendar construct for the meridian of oxford5 and of the arabian astronom abdilazi alkabucius 
6 in the frankeleyn tale chaucer mention the tabula toletanae7 a set of tabl compos by order ofpg 12 alphonso x king of castil and so call becaus they were adapt to the citi of toledo 
work which serv chaucer not as sourc of inform on scientif subject but as model for the treatment of astronom lore in literatur were the de consolation philosophia of boethius which chaucer translat and often made use of in his poetri and the work of dant whose influenc on chaucer probabl consider has been point out by sever writer notabl rambeau8 who discuss the parallel between the hous of fame and the divina commedia 
iii chaucer’ cosmolog chaucer wrote no poetic work have a cosmograph background as complet set forth as is that in dante’ divin comedi or that in milton’ paradis lost 
although his cosmolog refer are often incident they are not introduc in a pedant manner 
whenev they are not part of interpol from other writer his use of them is due to their intim relat to the life his poetri portray or to his appreci of their poetic valu 
when chaucer say for exampl that the sun has grown old and shine in capricorn with a paler light than is his wont he is not use a mere convent devic for show that winter has come but is express this fact in truli poetic manner and in word quit comprehens to the men of his day who were accustom to think of time relat in term of heaven phenomena 
popular and scientif view of the univers in chaucer’ centuri were by no mean the same 
the untaught man doubtless still thought of the earth as be flat as it appear to be as bound by the water of the ocean and as cover by a domelik materi firmament through which the water abov sometim came as rainpg 13 while as we have seen by the fourteenth centuri among scholar the geocentr system of astronomi was firm establish and the sphere and epicycl of ptolemi were becom more wide known 
it is the view held by the educ men of his centuri that chaucer’ poetri chiefli reflect 
1 
the celesti sphere and their movement when we read chaucer we are transport into a world in which the heaven bodi and their movement seem to bear a more intim relat to human life than they do in the world in which we live 
the thought of the revolv sphere carri sun moon and planet regul light and heat on the earth and exercis a mysteri influenc over terrestri event and human destini was a sublim concept and one that natur appeal to the imagin of a poet 
chaucer was impress alik by the vast of the revolv sphere in comparison to the earth’ small by their order arrang and by the unceas regular of their appear which seem to show that they should etern abid 
in the parlement of foul he interpol a passag from cicero’ somnium scipioni in which africanus appear to the sleep scipio point out to him the insignific of our littl earth when compar with the vast of the heaven and then admonish him to regard the thing of this world as of littl import when compar with the joy of the heaven life to come 
9 “than shew he him the litel erth that heer is at regard of the heven quantit and after shew he him the nyne speres� the regular arrang of the planetari sphere cling often to the poet’ fanci and he make mani allus to their order in the heaven 
he speak of mar as “the thridd heven lord above�10 and of venus as presid overpg 14 the “fift cercle�11 in troilus and criseyd the poet invok venus as the adorn light of the third heaven 
12 “o blis light of which the beme clere adorneth al the thridd heven faire�13 mediaev astronom as we have seen imagin nine sphere each of the seven innermost carri with it one of the planet in the order mention below the eighth sphere was that of the fix star and to account for the precess of the equinox men suppos it to have a slow motion from west to east round the axi of the zodiac the ninth or outermost sphere they call the primum mobil or the sphere of first motion and suppos it to revolv daili from east to west carri all the other sphere with it 
the thought of the two outer sphere the primum mobil whirl along with it all the inner sphere and the firmament bear host of bright star seem to have appeal strong to the poet’ imagin 
in the tale of the man of law the primum mobil is describ as crowd and hurl in diurnal revolut from east to west all the sphere that would natur follow the slow cours of the zodiac from west to east 
14 elsewher the primum mobil is call the “whele that bereth the sterres� and is said to turn the heaven with a “ravissh sweigh� “o thou maker of the whele that bereth the sterr which that art yfastn to thi perdur chayer andpg 15 tornest the heven with a ravissh sweigh and constreinest the sterr to suffren thi lawe�15 the firmament which in chaucer is not restrict to the eighth sphere but general refer to the whole expans of the heaven is mani time mention by chaucer and it appear on clear or cloudi night it chang aspect befor an impend storm or with the come of dawn beauti describ 
16 2 
the harmoni of the sphere some of the cosmolog idea reflect in chaucer’ write can be trace back to system older than the ptolema 
the beauti fanci that the univers is govern by harmoni had it origin in the philosophi of the pythagorean in the fourth centuri b c and continu to appeal to men’ imagin until the end of the middl age 
it was thought that the distanc of the planetari sphere from one anoth correspond to the interv of a music scale and that each sphere as it revolv sound one note of the scale 
when ask whi men could not hear the celesti harmoni the pythagorean said a blacksmith is deaf to the continu regular beat of the hammer in his shop so we are deaf to the music which the sphere have been send forth from etern 
in ancient and mediaev cosmolog it was onli the seven sphere of the planet that were general suppos to particip in this celesti music but the poet havepg 16 taken liberti with this idea and have given it to us in form suit their own fanci 
milton bid all the celesti sphere join in the heaven melodi “ring out ye crystal sphere onc bless our human earsif ye have power to touch our sens so and let your silver chime move in melodi timeand let the base of heaven’ deep organ blow and with your ninefold harmoni make up full consort to the angel symphony�17 shakespear let everi orb of the heaven send forth it note as it move “there’ not the smallest orb which thou behold’st but in his motion like an angel sing still quir to the youngey cherubins�18 chaucer too make all nine sphere particip “and after that the melody herd he that cometh of thilk spere thrye three that well is of musyk and melody in this world heer and caus of armonye�19 onli in unusu circumst can the music of the sphere be heard by mortal ear 
in the line just quot the celesti melodi is heard dure a dream or vision 
in troilus and criseyd after troilus’ death his spirit is born aloft to heaven whenc he behold the celesti orb and hear the melodi sent forth as they revolv pg 17 “and ther he saugh with ful avys the erratik sterr herkening armony with sown full of hevenish melodye�20 3 
the cardin point and the region of the world more primit in origin than the harmoni of the sphere are refer to the four element to the divis of the world and to the cardin point or quarter of the earth 
of these probabl the most primit is the last 
the idea of four cardin point the “before� the “behind� the “right� and the “left� later given the name north south east and west appear among peopl in their veri earliest stage of civil and becaus of it great use has remain and probabl will remain throughout the histori of the human race 
onli one of chaucer’ mani refer to the cardin point need be mention 
in the man of law tale b491ff 
the cardin point are first suggest by an allus to the four ‘spirit of tempest’ which were suppos to have their respect abod in the four quarter of earth and then specif name in the line follow “who bad the four spirit of tempest that power han tanoyen land and see ‘both north and south and also west and est anoyeth neither see ne land ne tree’� of almost equal antiqu are idea of the univers as a threefold world have heaven abov earth below and a region of dark and gloom beneath the earth 
chaucer usual speak of the threefold world the “tryne compas� as compris heaven earth and sea 
thus in the knight tale21 “‘o chast goddess of the wode grene to whom both heven and erth and see is sene quen of the regn of pluto derk and lowe’� pg 18fame’ palac is said to stand midway between heaven earth and sea “hir paley stant as i shal sey right even in midd of the wey betwixen heven erth and see�22 again in the second nonn tale the name ‘tryne compas’ is use of the threefold world and the three region are mention “that of the tryne compa lord and gyde is whom erth and see and heven out of rele ay herien�23 4 
heaven hell and purgatori in mediaev cosmolog idea of heaven hell and purgatori as more or less definit locat region where the spirit of the dead were either reward or punish etern or were purg of their earth sin in hope of futur blessed play an import part 
accord to dante’ poetic concept hell was a conic shape pit whose apex reach to the center of the earth purgatori was a mountain on the earth’ surfac on the summit of which was locat the garden of eden or the earth paradis and heaven was a motionless region beyond space and time the motionless sphere outsid of the primum mobil call the empyrean 
chaucer’ allus to heaven hell and purgatori are frequent but chiefli incident and give no such definit idea of their locat as we find in the divin comedi 
the nearest chaucer come to indic the place of heaven is in the parlement of foul 556 where africanus speak of heaven and then point to the galaxi “and right folk shal go after they dye to heven and shew him the galaxye� pg 19chaucer describ heaven as “swift and round and burning� thus to some extent depart from the concept of it usual held in his time “and right so as thise philosophr wryte that heven is swift and round and eek brenning right so was fayr cecili the whyte�24 in use the term “swift and round� chaucer must have been think of the primum mobil which as we have seen was thought to have a swift diurnal motion from east to west 
his use of the epithet “burning� is in conform with the mediaev concept of the empyrean or heaven of pure light as it is describ by dant 
chaucer doe not describ the form and locat of hell as definit as doe dant but the idea which he present of it by incident allus whether or not this was the view of it he himself held is practic the one common held in his day 
that hell is locat somewher within the depth of the earth is suggest in the knight tale25— “his felaw went and soght him down in helle� and in the man of law tale26 “o serpent under femininite lyk to the serpent depe in hell ybounde� in the person tale hell is describ as a horribl pit to which no natur light penetr fill with smoke flame and presid over by devil who await an opportun to draw sin soul to their punish 
27 elsewher in the same tale the parson describ hell as a region of disord the onli place in the world not subject to the univers law of natur and attribut this idea of it to job pg 20“and eek iob seith that ‘in hell is noon ordr of rule’ and albeit so that god hath creat all thing in right ordr and noth withouten ordr but all thing been ordeyn and nombr yet nathele they that been dampn been noth in ordr ne holden noon ordre�28 the word purgatori seldom occur in a liter sens in chaucer’ poetri but the figur use of it is frequent 
when the wife of bath is relat her experi in marri life she tell us that she was her fourth husband’ purgatori 
29 the old man ianuarie30 contempl marriag fear that he may lose hope of heaven hereaft becaus he will have his heaven here on earth in the joy of wed life 
his friend iustinus sarcast tell him that perhap his wife will be his purgatori god’ instrument of punish so that when he die his soul will skip to heaven quicker than an arrow from the bow 
to arcit releas from prison on condit that he never again enter theseus’ land banish will be a wors fate than the purgatori of life imprison for then even the sight of emely will be deni him “he seyd ‘alla that day that i was born 
now is my prison wors than biforn now is me shape etern to dwell noght in purgatori but in helle’�31 the idea of purgatori not as a place definit locat like dante’ mount of purgatori but rather as a period of punish and probat is express in these line from the parlement of foul 7884 pg 21 “‘but breker of the law soth to seyn and lecher folk after that they be dede shul alwey whirl about therth in peyn til mani a world be pass out of drede and than foryeven all hir wikk dede than shul they come unto that blis place to which to comen god thee send his grace’� chaucer use the idea of paradis for poetic purpos quit as often as that of purgatori 
he express the highest degre of earth beauti or joy by compar it with paradis 
criseyde’ face is said to be like the imag of paradis 
32 again in extol the marri life the poet say that it virtu are such “‘that in this world it is a paradys’�33 and later in the same tale woman is spoken of as “mann help and his confort his paradi terrestr and his disport�34 when aenea reach carthag he “is come to paradi out of the swolow of hell and thus in ioy remembreth him of his estat in troye�35 chaucer mention paradis sever time in it liter sens as the abod of adam and eve befor their fall 
in the monk tale we are told that adam held sway over all paradis except one tree 
36 again the pardon speak of the expuls of adam and eve from paradis “adam our fader and his wyf also fro paradi to labour and to wo were driven for that vyce it is no drede for whyl that adam fast as i redepg 22he was in paradi and whan that he eet of the fruyt defend on the tree anon he was outcast to we and peyne�37 5 
the four element 
the idea of four elements38 has it origin in the attempt of the earli greek cosmologist to discov the ultim principl of realiti in the univers 
thale reach the conclus that this principl was water anaximin that it was air and heracleitus fire while parmenid suppos two element fire or light subtl and rarefi and earth or night dens and heavi 
empedocl of agrigentum about 450 b c assum as primari element all four—fir air water and earth—of which each of his predecessor had assum onli one or two 
to explain the manifold phenomena of natur he suppos them to be produc by combin of the element in differ proport through the attract and repuls forc of ‘love’ and ‘discord’ this arbitrari assumpt of four element first made by empedocl persist in the popular imagin throughout the middl age and is like other cosmolog idea of antiqu sometim reflect in the poetri of the time 
the element in mediaev cosmolog were assign to a definit region of the univers 
be mortal and imperfect they occupi four sphere below the moon the element region or region of imperfect as distinguish from the ether region abov the moon 
immedi within the sphere of the moon came that of fire below this the air then water and lowest of all the solid sphere of earth 
pg 23 fire be the most ether of the element constant tend to rise upward while earth sink toward the center of the univers 
this contrast is a favorit idea with dant who say in the paradiso i 
112117 “‘wherefor they move to divers port o’er thegreat sea of be and each one withinstinct given it to bear it on 
this beareth the fire toward the moon thisi the mover in the heart of thing that diethi doth draw the earth togeth and unit it’� elsewher dant describ the lightn as flee it proper place when it strike the earth “‘but lightn flee it proper site ne’er dart as dost thou who art return thither’�39 and again “‘so from this cours sometim departeth thecreatur that hath power thus thrust to swervetoward some other part even as fire may be seen to dart down fromth cloud if it first rush be wrench asideto earth by fals seem pleasure’�40 the same thought of the tendenc of fire to rise and of earth to sink is found in chaucer’ translat of boethius41 “thou bindest the element by noumbr proporcion that the fyr that is purest ne flee nat over hye ne that the heviness ne draw nat adoun overlow the erth that ben ploung in the wateres� chaucer doe not make specif mention of the sphere of the element but he tell us plain that each element has been assign it proper region from which it may not escap iv chaucer’ astronomi chaucer’ treatment of astronom lore in his poetri differ much from his use of it in his prose write 
in poetic allus to heaven phenomena much attent to detail and a pedant regard for accuraci would be inappropri 
refer to astronomi in chaucer’ poetri are as a rule rather brief specif but not technic often pure convent but alway truli poetic 
there are inde occasion passag in chaucer’ poetri show so detail a knowledg of observational50 astronomi that they would seem astonish and to mani peopl out of place in modern poetri 
they were not so in chaucer’ time when the exig of practic life demand of the ordinari man a knowledg of astronomi far surpass that possess by most of our contemporari 
harri bailli in the introduct to the man of law tale determin the day of the month and hour of the day by make calcul from the observ posit of the sun in the sky and from the length of shadow although say chaucer “he were not depe expert in lore�51 such pg 28refer to technic detail of astronomi as we find in this passag are howev not common in chaucer’ poetri in his treatis on the astrolab on the other hand a profess scientif work design to instruct his young son loui in those element of astronomi and astrolog that were necessari for learn the use of the astrolab we have suffici evid that he was thorough familiar with the technic detail of the astronom scienc of his day 
in chaucer’ poetri the astronom refer employ are almost wholli of two kind refer show the time of day or season of the year at which the event narrat are suppos to take place and figur allus for purpos of illustr or comparison 
figur use of astronomi in chaucer vari from simpl simil as in the prologu to the canterburi tale where the friar’ eye are compar to twinkl stars52 to extend allegori like the compleynt of mar in which the myth of venus and mar is relat by describ the motion of the planet venus and mar for a certain period dure which venus overtak mar they are in conjunction53 for a short time and then venus becaus of her greater appar veloc leav mar behind 
one of the most magnific astronom figur employ by chaucer is in the hous ofpg 29 fame 
chaucer look up into the heaven and see a great golden eagl near the sun a sight so splendid that men could never have beheld it equal ‘unless the heaven had won anoth sun’ “hit was of gold and shone so bright that never saw men such a sight butif the heven hadd ywonn al new of gold anoth sonn so shoon the egl fethr bright and somwhat dounward gan hit lighte�54 besid mention the heaven bodi in time refer and figur allus chaucer also employ them often in descript of day and night of dawn and twilight and of the season 
it is with a poet’ joy in the warm spring sun that he write “bright was the day and blew the firmament phebus of gold his streme doun hath sent to gladen everi flour with his warmnesse�55 and with a poet’ delight in the new life and vigor that natur put forth when spring come that he write the line “forgeten had the erth his pore estat of winter that him nake made and mat and with his swerd of cold so sore greve now hath the atempr sonn al that relev that nake was and clad hit new agayn�56 chaucer’ astronom allus then except in the treatis on the astrolab and in his translat of boethius de consolation philosophia in which a philosoph interest in celesti phenomena is display are almost pg 30invari employ with poetic purpos 
these poetic allus to heaven phenomena howev togeth with the more technic and detail refer in chaucer’ prose work give evid of a rather extens knowledg of astronomi 
with all of the import observ movement of the heaven bodi he was perfect familiar and it is rather remark how mani of these he use in his poetri without give one the feel that he is air his knowledg 
1 
the sun of all the heaven bodi the one most often mention and employ for poetic purpos by chaucer is the sun 
chaucer has mani epithet for the sun but speak of him perhap most often in the classic manner as phebus or apollo 
he is call the “golden tress phebus�57 or the “laurercrown phebus�58 and when he make mar flee from venus’ palac he is call the “candel of ielosye�59 in the follow passag chaucer use three differ epithet for the sun within two line “the day honour and the heven ye the night fo al this clepe i the sonn gan westren fast and dounward for to wrye as he that hadd his day cour yronne�60 sometim chaucer give the sun the various accessori with which classic myth had endow him—th four swift steed the rosi chariot and fieri torch “and phebus with his rosi cart sone gan after that to dress him up to fare�61“‘now am i war that pirous and tho swift stede three which that drawen forth the sonn charpg 31hath goon some bypath in despyt of me’�62 “phebus that was comen hast within the paleysy sturd with torch in hond of which the streme bright on venus chambr knokkeden ful lighte�63 almost alway when chaucer wish to mention the time of day at which the event he is relat take place he doe so by describ the sun’ posit in the sky or the direct of his motion 
we can imagin that chaucer often smile as he did this for he sometim humor apolog for his poetic conceit and convent by express his idea immedi afterward in perfect plain term 
such is the case in the passag alreadi quot where chaucer refer to the sun by the epithet “day honour� “heven ye� and “night fo� and then explain them by say “al this clepe i the sonne� and in the line “til that the bright sonn lost his hew for thorisont hath reft the sonn his light� explain by the simpl word “this is as much to sey as it was night�64 thus it is that chaucer’ poetic refer to the appar daili motion of the sun about the earth are near alway simpli in the form of allus to his rise and set 
canace in the squier tale f 384 ff 
is said to rise at dawn look as bright and fresh as the spring sun risen four degre from the horizon 
“up ryseth fressh canace hirselv as rodi and bright as dooth the yong sonn that in the ram65 is four degre upronn noon hyer was he whan she redi was� mani of these refer to the rise and set of the sun might be mention if space permit simpli for their beauti as poetri 
one of the most beauti is the follow pg 32 “and fyri phebus ryseth up so bright that al the orient laugheth of the light and with his streme dryeth in the greve the silver drope hang on the leves�66 when in the canterburi tale the mancipl has finish his tale chaucer determin the time by observ the posit of the sun and by make calcul from the length of his own shadow “bi that the mauncipl hadd his tale al end the sonn fro the south lyne was descend so low that he nas nat to my sight degre nyne and twenti as in hight 
four of the clokk it was tho as i gess for eleven foot or litel more or less my shadw was at thilk tyme as there of swich feet as my length part were in six feet equal of porporcioun�67 we must not omit mention of the humor touch with which chaucer in the mock heroic tale of chanticl and the fox told by the nun’ priest make even the rooster determin the time of day by observ the altitud of the sun in the sky “chauntecl in al his pryde his seven wyve walkyng by his syde cast up his eyen to the bright sonn that in the sign of taurus hadd yronn twenti degre and oon and somewhat more and knew by kynd and by noon other lore that it was pryme and crew with blis steven 
‘the sonne’ he sayd ‘is clomben up on heven fourti degre and oon and more ywis’�68 pg 33moreov this remark rooster observ that the sun had pass the twentyfirst degre in taurus and we are told elsewher that he knew each ascens of the equinocti and crew at each that is he crew everi hour as 15� of the equinocti correspond to an hour “wel siker was his crow in his logg than is a clokk or an abbey orlogg 
by natur knew he ech ascencioun69 of th’ equinoxi in thilk toun for whan degre fiften were ascend thann crew he that it might nat ben amended�70 chaucer announc the approach of even by describ the posit and appear of the sun more often than ani other time of the day 
in the legend of good women he speak of the sun’ leav the south point71 of his daili cours and approach the west “whan that the sonn out of the south gan weste�72 and again of his westward motion in the line “and whan that hit is eve i rene blyve as sone as ever the sonn ginneth weste�73 elsewher chaucer refer to the set of the sun by say that he has complet his “ark divine� and may no longer remain on the horizon74 or by say that the ‘horizon has bereft the sun of his light’75 chaucer’ refer to the daili motion of the sun about the earth are apt to sound to us like pure poetic figur so accustom are we to refer to the sun what we know to be the earth’ rotatori motion by speak of his appar daili motion thus figur as if it were real 
chaucer’ manner of describ the revolut of the heaven bodi about the earth and his applic of poetic epithet to them are figur but the motion itself waspg 34 meant liter and was believ in by the men of his centuri becaus onli the geocentr system of astronomi was then known 
if chaucer had been in advanc of his centuri in this respect there would certain be some hint of the fact in his write 
refer in chaucer to the sun’ year motion are in the same sens liter 
the appar motion of the sun along the ecliptic76 which we know to be caus by the earth’ year motion in an ellipt orbit around the sun was then believ to be an actual movement of the sun carri along by his revolv sphere 
like the refer to the sun’ daili movement those that mention his year motion along the eclipt are also usual time refer 
the season of the year is indic by defin the sun’ posit among the sign of the zodiac 
the canterburi pilgrim set out on their journey in april when “the yong sonn hath in the ram his half cours yronne�77 v astrolog lore in chaucer astrolog though resembl a scienc in that it make use of observ and seek to establish law govern it data is in realiti a faith or creed 
it had it begin so tradit tell us in the faith of the ancient babylonian in certain astral deiti who exert an influenc upon terrestri event and human life 
the basi of this faith was not altogeth illog but contain a germ of truth 
of all the heaven bodi the sun exert the most obvious effect upon the earth the sun brought day and night summer and winter his ray lure grow thing from mother earth and so gave susten to mankind 
but to the ancient peopl of the orient the sun was also often a bane power he could destroy as well as give life 
therefor the ancient came to look upon the sun as a great and power god to be worship and propiti by men 
and if the sun was such a power it was natur to believ that all the other bright orb of the sky were lesser pg 52divin who exercis more limit power on the earth 
from this begin base as we have seen on a germ of fact by the power of his imagin and credul man extend more and more the power of these sider divin attribut to their volit and influenc all the most insignific as well as the most import terrestri event 
and if the heaven bodi by revolv about the earth in ceaseless harmoni effect the recurr of day and night and of the season and if their configur were respons for the minutest event in natur was it not natur to suppos that besid affect man thus indirect they also influenc him direct and were respons for his conduct and for the veri qualiti of his mind and soul 
perhap the astonish varieti of the influenc that the celesti bodi from ancient until modern time were suppos to exercis over the world and the life of mankind can be account for by imagin some such process of thought to have been involv in the begin of astrolog 
it was but a step from faith in stellar influenc on our earth to the belief that as the heaven movement were govern by immut law so their influenc upon the world would follow certain law and it effect in the futur could be determin as certain as could the come revolut and conjunct of the star 
out of this twofold belief was evolv a complex system of divin the origin of which was forgotten as men believ in it invent reason for believ pretend that their faith was found on a long seri of observ 
the chaldean believ that in discov the unceas regular of the celesti motion they had found the veri law of life and they built upon this convict a mass of absolut rigid dogma 
but when experi beli these dogma unabl to realiz the falsiti of their presupposit and to give up their faith in the divin star the astrolog invent new dogma to explain the old one thus pile up a bodi of complic and oftenpg 53 contradictori doctrin that will ever be to the student a sourc of perplex and astonish 
on it philosoph side astrolog was a system of astral theolog develop not by popular thought but through the care observ and specul of learn priest and scholar 
it was a pure eastern scienc which came into be on the chaldean plain and in the nile valley 
as far as we know it was entir unknown to ani of the primit aryan race from hindostan to scandinavia 
astrolog as a system of divin never gain a foothold in greec dure the brightest period of her intellectu life 
but the dogma of astral divin was zealous maintain by the greatest of greek philosoph 
plato the great idealist whose influenc upon the theolog of the ancient and even of the modern world was more profound than that of ani other thinker call the star “visibl gods� rank them just below the suprem etern be and to plato these celesti god were infinit superior to the anthropomorph god of the popular religion who resembl men in their passion and were superior to them onli in beauti of form and in power 
aristotl defend with no less zeal the doctrin of the divin of the star see in them etern substanc principl of movement and therefor divin be 
in the hellenist period zeno the stoic and his follow proclaim the supremaci of the sider divin even more strong than the school of plato and aristotl had done 
the stoic conceiv the world as a great organ whose “sympathetic� forc constant interact upon one anoth govern by reason which was of the essenc of ether fire the primordi substanc of the univers 
to the star the purest manifest of the power of this ether substanc were attribut the greatest influenc and the loftiest divin qualiti 
the stoic develop the doctrin of fatal which is the inevit outcom of faith in stellar influenc on human life to it consequ yet they prove by fact that fatal is not incompat with pg 54activ and virtuous live 
by the end of the roman imperi period astrolog had transform pagan replac the old societi of immort who were scarc superior to mortal except in be exempt from old age and death by faith in the etern be who ran their cours in perfect harmoni throughout the age whose power regul by the unvari celesti motion extend over all the earth and determin the destini of the whole human race 
astrolog as a scienc and a system of divin exert a profound influenc over the mediaev mind 
no court was without it practic astrolog and the univers all had their professor of astrolog 
the practic of astrolog was an essenti part of the physician’ profess and befor prescrib for a patient it was thought quit as import to determin the posit of the planet as the natur of the diseas 
139 interest evid of this fact is found in the prologu to the canterburi tale where chaucer speak of the doctour’ knowledg and use of astrolog as if it were his chief excel as a physician “in al this world ne was ther noon him lyk to speke of phisik and of surgery for he was ground in astronomy 
he kept his pacient a ful greet del in hour by his magik naturel 
wel coud he fortunen the ascend of his imag for his pacient�140 yet in spite of the esteem in which astrolog divin was held by most peopl in the middl age dant the greatest expon of the thought and learn of that period show practic no knowledg of the technic and practic side of astrolog 
when he refer to the specif effect of the planet it is onli to those most familiar known and he nowher use such technic term as “houses� or “aspects� of planet 
but dant like the great philosoph of the earlier period was undoubt pg 55influenc by the philosoph doctrin of astrolog and a general belief in the influenc of the celesti sphere upon human life was deepli root in his mind 
to him the ceaseless and harmoni movement of the celesti bodi were the manifest and instrument of god’ provid and were ordain by the first mover to govern the destini of the earth and human life 
we can see this convict of dante’ with perfect certainti when we read the divina commedia 
for dante’ poetri is high subject on everi page his own person thought and feel are reveal quit open 
chaucer’ poetri on the other hand is object he tell us almost noth direct about himself and what we learn of him in his write is almost entir by infer 
chaucer’ frequent use of astrolog in his poetri would make it hard to believ that he was not consider influenc by it philosoph aspect at least in the general way that dant was 
part and parcel of the dramat action in most of his poem is the idea of stellar influenc 
yet we cannot assert with the same assur that we can say it of dant that chaucer believ even in a general way in the influenc of the star on human life 
in dante’ poetri as we have said the poet himself is alway befor us 
chaucer with socrat ironi alway make it plain to the reader that his attitud is pure object that he is onli the narrat of what he has seen or dream onli the copyist of another’ stori 
even when chaucer make himself one of the protagonist as in the hous of fame and the canterburi tale it is onli that his narrat may be the more convinc 
he tell a stori and make it protagonist actual live befor us as individu men and women 
it is possibl to imagin all of his use of astrolog in his poetri not as the reflect of his own faith in it cosmic philosophi but the express of his genius for understand peopl and truth describ life and charact 
consider discuss as to chaucer’ attitud toward astrolog has been call forth by passag in whichpg 56 he speak in word of scorn with regard to some of the practic and magic art that were often use in connect with astrolog 
in the astrolab after describ somewhat at length the favor and unfavor posit of planet he say “nathel thise ben observauncez of iudici matier and ryte of payen in which my spirit ne hath no feith ne no know of hir horoscopum�141 again in the franklin’ tale he speak in a similar disdain tone of astrolog magic “he him remembr that upon a day at orlien in studi a book he say of magik naturel which his felaw that was that tyme a bachel of law al were he ther to lern anoth craft had prive upon his desk ylaft which book spak muchel of the operacioun touching the eight and twenti mansioun that longen to the mone and swich foly as in our day is not worth a flye for holi chirch feith in our bilev ne suffreth noon illus us to greve�142 and elsewher in the same tale he write “so att last he hath his tyme yfound to maken his iap and his wreccedness of switch a superstici cursednesse�143 here follow a long descript of the clerk’ instrument and astrolog observ end in the line “for swich illusioun and swich meschaunc as hethen folk use in thilk day for which no lenger make he delay but thurgh his magik for a wyke or twey it seem that all the rokk were aweye�144 pg 57on the strength of these passag professor t r lounsbury145 hold that chaucer was far ahead of most of his contemporari in his attitud toward the superstiti practic connect with the astrolog of his day that his attitud toward judici astrolog was one of total disbelief and scorn and he even goe so far as to say that chaucer was guilti of a breach of artist workmanship in express his disbelief so scorn in a tale in which the veri climax of the dramat action depend upon a feat of astrolog magic

107 crystal gaze befor we start this chapter will you just take a look at the follow short list of term use in crystal gaze and spiritu 
you will find that they will make what follow quit clear and that they will be use to refer to 
spiritualistic—belong to the spirit world 
second sight—th power which all have but few develop 
the power to see the futur and other thing with the spirit eye 
aura—th circl of thought which each one of us is unconsci send out by our charact and person 
the crystal—ani object which help to fix our attent ie a crystal a bowl of water shine metal 
there is noth about the crystal that is magic by itself 
psychic persons—person possess second sight 
look into the futur it is believ that this portion of the book will be found particular interest becaus it is here that we touch upon spiritu perhap one of the most talkedof subject of today 
in crystal gaze we actual see mani thing happen which mayb have not happen as yet 
in palmistri and astrolog we see the sign but not the actual event 
anoth distinct differ is that in crystal gaze it is imposs to give definit instruct as to how to receiv these messag or vision becaus there is no how 
what we hope to do in this chapter is to show you that perhap you possess power of which you know noth 
without make the foolish mistak of take this subject too serious you will be abl to interest and amus your friend 
you may say but i havent got this power—i could never see anyth in a crystal 
dont say that and dont think it 
we all have a littl of this power sleep within us 
if we wish to improv it we must use and practis it but dont overdo the thing 
to understand crystal gaze even a littl it is quit import to know just a few simpl fact about spiritu the studi of the spirit world 
this second sight or clairvoy call it what you will is mere in it childhood as yet 
a veri short while ago we should have thought it a miracl for anyon to speak from new york to london along a wire 
now we think no more of it than we should of cross a road 
so with the crystal 
at present a few of us onli are abl to see more or108 less clear those vision of the futur 
who know but that in some futur time we shall consid this quit an ordinari and natur thing to do just like telephon for instanc 
the first thing to get hold of is this we have not one bodi but two 
an earth bodi and it exact copi in a spirit bodi 
by this i do not mean the soul but rather our earth bodi with all it featur just as befor is copi in a spirit of ether bodi 
this may sound difficult but just tri to grasp the idea 
in spiritu there are two of each one of us one an earth you the other dwell usual in your earth bodi a spiritu you 
but sometim this spirit bodi escap from it earth prison mayb dure sleep sometim when we look into the crystal and sometim in what is call a tranc or artifici sleep 
it is then when the spirit bodi is free that vision of futur thing are seen and mayb premonit or feel of the futur are felt 
our spirit bodi with it ten thousand time more clearsight eye see thing which are invis to the earth eye 
this bodi is abl to travel swift from place to place although it alway keep a link or connect with it earth doubl 
when a person goe off into a tranc this is what has happen 
the earth bodi sleep while the spiritu bodi roam about the futur past and present or perhap visit distant place 
it is of cours abl to speak with other spirit bodi and thus get inform about other folk who have pass over as the spiritualist call death 
now perhap you can better appreci the wonder stori which you hear about medium peopl who pass into these tranc who have spoken—or are alleg to have spoken for the verdict of scienc is not proven—with the voic of folk long dead and whom they have never seen 
while everyon doe not activ possess this power of releas his spirit bodi we all have it 
that this is true can be seen in sever way 
have you never had a presenti or feel of evil to come a strong feel which it took all your determin and common sens to drive away 
anyway you will have frequent heard other peopl say i had a feel that soandso would happen 
that feel is explain by this wander of the spirit bodi for a short time we have had our spirit eye freeli open and have gain a glimps of the unknown 
as our spirit eye are as yet undevelop it is but a glimps then down fall the thick curtain and the mysteri is onc more hidden from us 
just as some children learn to walk more easili than other so do some peopl learn to walk with their spirit bodi and to speak the spirit languag more quick than other 
which seem veri natur doesnt it 
let us briefli refresh our mind with the absolut necessari fact which you must know to understand the first step in fortunetel by the crystal 
what we are go to say next will then be more readili understood— 109 firstly—w have not one bodi but two an earth and a spiritu bodi 
secondly—though normal contain in the earth bodi it is possibl for the spirit to escap from it prison and pass from place to place at a speed greater than light 
this occur dure sleep the artifici or forc sleep of the tranc and also when one gaze into the crystal 
thirdly—w have four eye 
two earth eye and two veri much keener spirit eye 
it is with these spirit eye that we see the futur and the past in the crystal 
fourthly—each one of us is send out thoughtwav at this moment 
these are known by spiritualist as our aura 
it is found in differ color which depend on our charact or the thought leav us 
certain red show rage for instanc 
what the crystal is for the first thing to get hold of is that there is noth magic or in ani way wonder about the crystal itself 
it is mere a mean of fix the attent of our earth eye so that we may see the more clear with our spirit eye 
now for a few hint upon actual look into the crystal 
when you gaze into whatev object you have chosen your earth bodi and earth eye pass into a more or less sleepi state thus enabl your spirit bodi to escap 
that give us our first point to rememb 
here it is when you look into the crystal whatev you do dont worri about whether or not you will see anyth 
tri to think steadili of what you wish to see this will at first seem hard but practic will help you and practic make perfect 
then rememb to keep ani glare of light from the eye it is wise to sit with one back toward the light 
let your surround be quiet and peac there must be absolut noth which may catch your attent and so take it off the crystal 
if for instanc a noisi bus or other vehicl were to pass dure the time in which you were make your attempt it would probabl disturb thing veri much 
one should never be discourag if noth whatev is seen at the first few attempt 
a puppi cannot at first see out of it eye and it is the same with a beginn in crystal gaze his spirit eye may take some littl time to open while other more fortun may find their open almost at onc 
never strain the eye in an unwink stare 
let them wink and blink quit natur 
to do anyth els would be sure to take your attent from the pictur which you wish to see 
how to begin the best thing to do is to tri these various method and then see for yourself which is the most success in your own individu case 
here are a few mean you might tri in order to test this for yourself 
110 use either a 1 crystal 2 a polish object 3 a bright coin 4 a sparkl gem or 5 ordinari glass in the shape of a sphere or ball 
there are other but they are not import 
in conclus it will be of interest to know just what you may expect to see when and if your spirit eye open 
probabl a misti fog appear will first be seen in the crystal 
this will remain for some littl time until final the scene or person whatev it may be will appear 
the latter may be faint and dim or it may be clearcut like a good photograph 
the clear or otherwis will depend among other thing upon the keen of sight of the spirit eye 
it will also be influenc by the degre of quiet and upon the absenc of anyth like to disturb the searcher in the realm of the futur 
111 the moon and the luck it bring peopl of all age have look upon the moon as a provid of good and bad luck and most of us have probabl notic that it has influenc our action at time 
here are some of the belief that are centuri old 
if you see a new moon over your right shoulder it mean that you will experi good luck all the month 
if you have money in your pocket and you meet the new moon face to face turn the money over and you will not run short of money that month 
it is unlucki to see the new moon through glass 
if you do go out of door curtsey three time to the moon and turn some silver in your hand 
this will break the spell which will be cast over you if you do not do as direct 
there is one littl point connect with this superstit which has set us think 
what of all those individu who wear glass 
we do not know the answer 
there is a strong preval idea that everyth fall to the lot of man when the moon is wax will increas or prosper but thing decreas and do not prosper when the moon is on the wane 
irish colleen were wont to drop on their knee when they first caught sight of the new moon and say oh moon leav us as well as you have found us 
and long ago yorkshir maiden did worship the new moon on their bent knee kneel upon the earthcast stone 
if the full moon known as the harvest moon appear wateri it is an ill sign for the harvest 
the harvest moon is due about the middl of septemb 
if the moon show a silver shield be not afraid to reap your field but if she rise halo round soon well tread on delug ground 
if the moon chang on a sunday there will be a flood befor the month is out 
a saturday moon if it come onc in seven year come too soon 
a fog and a small moon bring an easter wind soon 
in the wane of the moon cloudi morn fair afternoon 
pale moon doth rain red moon doth blow white moon doth neither rain nor snow 
when the moon halo is far the storm is nar near 
when the moon halo is nar the storm is far 
it has long been a custom for girl to go to the nearest stile to turn their back on the first new moon after midsumm and to chant these vers all hail new moon all hail to thee 
i prithe good moon reveal to me this night who shall my true love be 
who he is and what he wear and what he doe all month and year 
112 if she were to be marri in the cours of the next twelv month the moon answer her question dure her sleep of the same even 
in mani part of the countri it is suppos that on christma eve the moon will help maiden to find out when they are to be marri 
the plan is for a maiden to borrow a silk handkerchief from a male relat and to take it and a mirror to some sheet of water while the night is dark 
she must go quit alon but the sheet of water may be an unromant pail full to the brim station at the bottom of the garden 
as soon as the moon show itself the maiden place the flimsi piec of silk in front of her eye and by hold the mirror half toward the moon and half toward the water it is possibl for her to see more than a pair of reflect 
the number of reflect are the month which will ensu befor her wed bell ring out 
we recent came across the follow inform in a document quit three hundr year old the first second and third day of the moon age are lucki for buy and sell the seventh ninth and eleventh are lucki for engag and marriag the sixteenth and twentyfirst are not lucki for anyth 
the same document affirm that a babi born befor the new moon is twentyfour hour old is sure to be lucki 
anyth lost dure the second twentyfour hour of the moon age is sure to be found 
all thing begun on the fifth twentyfour hour will turn out success 
a dream experienc on the eighth twentyfour hour must come true 
113 chapter xv 
chirom and it origin chirom is a scienc which teach us to read not onli the charact but the whole destiny—for good or evil the length of life and often the manner of death of a man by the line and mark to be seen in his hand 
this studi is sometim call palmistri in which case howev it proper refer onli to a judgment form from what appear in the palm of the hand whilst chirom taken from the word cheir a hand and manteia divin signifi the revel made by the hand taken as a whole 
chirom is near as ancient as astrolog with which it is indissolubl connect for the hand repres as has been befor said a natur horoscop which is place upon it at the time both of the concept and the birth by the influenc of the star 
the seven planet are all repres in the hand and also the twelv sign of the zodiac so that the cast of a nativ is needless as by simpli examin a hand by the light of chirom we can indic what planet have been power at the time of birth and what therefor will be their effect for good or evil over the exist and we can also find the date of the princip event of the life 
we find mani allus to this subject in the bibl and still more in the ancient kabbala 
the holi kabbala as it was call by the magi must not be confound with what is call the black art it is on the contrari the quintess of reason and moral as they were understood by the ancient and contain that tradit scienc of the secret of natur which from age to age is born toward us as the wave is carri by the tide to the shore but it has been transmit obscur becaus the doctrin of the kabbala were known onli in those earli age to the adept and the initi later on of neophyt was onli yield after a seri of sever and terribl ordeal whilst the revel of it mysteri to the uniniti was punish by death 
the necess of silenc was in fact one of the princip tenet of the kabbala and is repres in the figur of addanari16 by the posit of the finger of the hand hold the flower branch of abund the thumb and the first two finger which in chirom repres will power and fatal are held open whilst the third and fourth finger repres light and scienc are close 
this was meant to indic to the good—th initiated—that they would have when unit strength and will to direct fate but that they must keep hidden from the wick and ignor both light and scienc 
it must howev in justic to the ancient kabbalist be suggest that their inculc of silenc probabl aros not so much from a desir of domin but rather from the fact that feel themselv superior in knowledg they thought they were obey a divin law in refus to the wick those light which when possess by them led as perhap they had sometim found to error 
we see thing in a wider light give or tri to give equal knowledg to all without submit the ignor to the ordeal of initi to prove their worthi as recipi but after all it amount to much the same thing—giv to all men truth and light in abund but all will not profit by it 
we see this everi day in our colleg system the lesson is the same for all but it is onli the few who profit by it and although we appear to be obey a divin law in open the way of light and life—th life of knowledge—to all as god make his sun to shine on good and bad equal still we can in some sort understand the feel of the ancient magi whose motto was know dare will but keep silenc 
to face chapter xvi 
chapter xvi 
the princip line in the hand and the mount in the plate belong to this chapter we give a hand on which are mark the princip line seen on the palm three of which viz the line of life the line of head and the line of heart are found in a clearer or fainter degre on all hand but which vari as regard their relat posit in everi hand 
the first and largest that which encircl the thumb is call the line of life by the length colour and even or the revers of this line the length of life is indic and also the ill and accid by which the life is menac in run it cours 
the line immedi abov it cross the palm of the hand is the line of head by it we are to judg of the intellectu power 
abov it is the line of heart from which we form an opinion of the strength of affect or the want of it in the nativ 
the line which are not alway to be found are the line go from the wrist to the finger of saturn which is call the saturnian line and which show the event of the life the line of the sun which goe toward the finger of the sun and which indic success in art literatur or the pursuit of rich and the line of health which goe from the wrist to the finger of mercuri this line is often absent in a hand 
all these line will be more fulli discuss further on at present it is onli necessari to name them in order to explain the plate belong to this chapter 
at the base of each figur there is a mount more or less develop on everi hand 
now each of these mount correspond with one of the planet from which it has receiv more or less influenc accord to it develop and the sign or mark to be found upon it 
it will be seen also from the plate that the ancient gave to each finger the name of one of the planet thus— the first finger repres jupit the mount at it base be call the mount of jupit 
the second saturn the mount at it root be the mount of saturn 
the third the sun the mount below be the mount of the sun 
the fourth mercuri the mount at it base be call the mount of mercuri 
the thumb is sacr to venus and the root of the thumb is call the mount of venus 
it will also be seen that the planet mar although no finger is dedic to it is twice repres in the hand along the side of the palm by the mount of mar and in the palm between the line of life and the line of the head which is call the plain of mar 
the moon is onli repres by the mount of the moon at the lower part of the palm on the opposit side of the hand to the thumb 
when these mount are well in their place and clear but not too strong defin they give the qualiti of the planet they repres but when ani mount is not well mark or even as frequent happen is quit defici there is a want of the qualiti shown to exist where the mount is clear defin 
if the mount are not onli illdefin but repres by a caviti that caviti would indic the exist of qualiti which are the revers of those indic by the mount wherea an exceed develop would denot an excess of the qualiti given by the mount 
thus the mount of jupit which is immedi under the index finger when fair develop indic nobl ambit willpow love of natur kindli generos religion and happi marriag 
when in excess—that is when the mount is so larg as to invad that next it—th mount of saturn—it give superstit exagger pride and domin selfassert 
the total absenc of this mount which is sometim but rare seen indic cold selfish irreligion and that want of digniti which is produc by the utter absenc of selfrespect 
the mount of saturn is found immedi beneath the second finger which the ancient assign to saturn the planet of fatal 
saturn give extrem misfortun or extrem good fortun accord to the develop of the mount and the sign and line to be seen upon it and the cours of the saturnian line or line of fate of which we will speak further on in the palm of the hand 
this mount also denot a tendenc to occult scienc 
those born special under the influenc of saturn are timid lover of solitud and veri seldom marri but are veri persist in their affect when they do love 
saturn when well develop give prudenc wisdom and to a certain extent success when in excess it give sad taciturn ascetic dread of the afterlif and yet sometim a predisposit to suicid 
the total absenc of the mount indic an insignific exist 
the mount of the sun is place at the root of the third finger which was sacr to the sun when this mount is well develop it indic love of art and literatur which show itself accord to tempera in poetri paint sculptur or music it give also religion of the �sthetic toler sort grace rich and celebr in excess it give love of show frivol and vainglori 
the total absenc of the mount mean a thorough materi exist absenc of all tast for art—a life without colour a day without sunlight 
the mount of mercuri is found at the base of the fourth finger and when well defin indic intellig success in scienc and in occult studi the love of work and activ both of mind and bodi and eloqu in excess it give impud theft and falsehood absenc of the mount indic no aptitud for scienc no intellectuality—a negat exist 
of cours should the mount of the sun be well defin the last qualiti would be overridden by the success which that indic 
the mount of mar is at the side of the hand opposit the thumb just below the mount of mercuri and when well develop indic courag ardour and resolut in excess it give cruelti anger reveng and tyranni the absenc of the mount give cowardic and want of selfcommand 
the mount of the moon is found immedi below that of mar and when well develop give imagin of the dreami sentiment order gentl melancholi and love of solitud in excess it give morbid melancholi capric and fantast imagin the absenc of the mount indic want of poetri in the natur positiv 
the mount of venus which is form by the root of the thumb indic when fair develop love of the beauti melodi in music the desir of pleas and sensuous tender in excess it give love of materi pleasur coquetri inconst and when other sign afterward to be explain are also seen in the hand extrem sensual

well listen

one day some few year ago it befel that i was seat alon in the hall where i hold my court 
it was the afternoon hour all the suit of the day had been dispos of punish had been mete out to those who deserv it justic had been done to rich and poor alik in accord with the order of our most righteous master akbar to whom be all honour and glori 
i had taken from my garment my silver betelnut box and was leisur spread on a leaf the smear of lime preparatori to enjoy my pan supari muse the while on the strang littl ironi of life that came to my knowledg each day in the discharg of my magisteri function 
all at onc a shadow from the open doorway fell across the room 
rais my eye i beheld the tall figur of a man 
on meet my look he bow his bodi and with both hand outstretch courteous salaam me 
protector of the poor listen to my stori he said 
in silenc while i adjust the fragment of betelnut on the lime leaf and roll up the morsel i motion him to a place on the edg of the carpet whereon i myself sat 
for my first glanc had shown me that the stranger was a man of consequ his garment be rich and his look that of one accustom to the exercis of author 
he took his seat and arrang his flow and fine embroid robe around him 
i profferedpg 172 him the pan supari i had prepar but with a wave of the hand he declin this courtesi 
so i place the morsel in my own mouth fell to it medit mastic and await the begin of his tale 
i am a welltodo travel as you would think 
o kadi—a pilgrim on my way to the sacr shrine of juggernaut as i profess myself to all who make inquiri and to whom an answer is due 
but i am not what i appear to be 
in realiti you behold in me—a thug 
the man lower his voic mysteri when he pronounc the last word bend forward so that i might hear it 
and what may be a thug 
i ask for the name to me was quit a new one 
listen he said eager and still in a low whisper 
the thug are worshipp of bowani 
there are countless thousand who worship kali the dread goddess i repli 
yes but we the thug not onli worship her as the wife of siva god of destruct but we are her devot priest who put men to death in her name and for her glori 
now inde did i prick up my ear and listen intent 
but i did not suffer my awaken interest to betray itself in look or tone of voic 
some fanat may seek to justifi human sacrific i said 
i was tread cautious later i would tell the man that such foul deed were against the decre of akbar and involv the penalti of deathpg 173 under the feet of eleph 
but meanwhil i want his confess 
ah you know noth about the thug continu the stranger 
but hearken to me for i have come to tell you all and for a reason you will present understand 
we are thousand strong and we live in all part of hindustan and the deccan 
we are cast brother and are bound togeth by our worship of bowani 
the tradit of our creed have been hand down for generat from father to son 
you have never heard of the thug o kadi although you sit in the place of justic 
do you know whi 
becaus i am the veri first of the sect who has broken his vow of silenc and spoken the word thug to one outsid our secret associ 
yet you say you are thousand strong 
yes we are strong in number but stronger still in our fidel to our vow 
when onc we have sworn on the sacr pickax it is imposs to speak word of treacheri 
if it be for the good and happi of all men i interpol encourag him to keep on speak freeli there can be no treacheri no break of vow in reveal the truth 
it is to reveal the truth that i have come to you 
it is by the order of bowani herself for i have wrong her and she is angri and has loud proclaim to me that thugge is ended—that her protect is for ever withdrawn from me and my fellow becaus o miseri we have grievous offend her 
hark 
do you not hear the voic of bowani even now 
the man rais his face toward the rafter of the room and with rightpg 174 hand uplift his attitud was one of intent listen 
unworthi unworthi unworthi he murmur in a strang absent monoton as if repeat word he was actual hear 
you have broken my law 
go now to your doom you and all your brother 
such priest kali will not have 
thugge is no more 
i will seek some other worshipp 
after a paus of tens silenc as if the listen was await for more he drop hand and eye 
and now my mind took a new turn of thought 
there was the confus unmistak glare of insan in the man eye 
half unconsci i lean back on my cushion and place a hand upon the dagger in my kummerbund 
the stranger notic the movement and lunat though he undoubt appear to be interpret my thought 
be not afraid of me master he said 
this is the onli weapon i carri 
and with these word he slip off a silken scarf that he had been wear loos around his throat and toss it on the carpet between us 
now was i all the more confirm in my estim of his mad 
to call such a thing a weapon—a strip of soft fabric that might kill a butterfli but would be poor defenc inde to reli on against sword or dagger 
i suppos i smile contemptu for again the man read my thought 
then instant did he do a thing that made mypg 175 blood run cold 
with a toss of the scarf into the air he form it into a noos and this he threw over one upbend knee 
next with a swift twist of fierc hand he drew the knot tight and so terribl realist was his action that for the moment i saw abov his knee the contort mouth and protrud eye of his sudden strangl victim 
there was horror in my gaze now but onli calm profession pride in his as he flung back the still loop and knot kerchief on to the carpet 
yes i am a strangler he said calm as are all the thug born to becom strangler and taught how to use the roomal in earli youth by their own father hand 
of strangl as a mean of murder i of cours knew and inde dure the year of my magistraci i had heard vagu rumour of robber habitu resort to this method of dispatch their victim rather than to club or sword 
but such appal dexter as this man display in the handl of an innocentlook silken scarf i had never imagin
